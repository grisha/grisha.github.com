      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time (over a year ago) I found myself needing to store large numbers of&#xA;integers in memory. The goal was to store a graph of all our&#xA;purchasers and items purchased, so that we could quickly identify&#xA;like-minded purchasers based on common purchases and make real-time&#xA;recommendations of the form &amp;ldquo;people like you also bought&amp;rdquo;. This&#xA;approach is commonly known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering&#34;&gt;collaborative filtering&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;and exactly how we did it would be a subject of some future post&#xA;(perhaps).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
