  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have a Golang HTTP service, chances are, you will need to restart it
on occasion to upgrade the binary or change some configuration. And if
you (like me) have been taking graceful restart for granted because
the webserver took care of it, you may find this recipe very handy
because with Golang you need to roll your own graceful restart.</p>

<p>There are actually two problems that need to be solved here. First is
the UNIX side of the graceful restart, i.e. the mechanism by which a
process can restart itself without closing the listening socket. The
second problem is ensuring that all in-progress requests are properly
completed or timed-out.</p>

<h2>Restarting without closing the socket</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fork a new process which inherits the listening socket.</li>
<li>The child performs initialization and starts accepting connections on
the socket.</li>
<li>Immediately after, child sends a signal to the parent causing the
parent to stop accepting connecitons and terminate.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Forking a new process</h3>

<p>There is more than one way to fork a process using the Golang lib, but
for this particular case
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/#Command">exec.Command</a> is the way to
go. This is because the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/#Cmd">Cmd struct</a> this function returns has
the ExtraFiles member. <code>ExtraFiles</code> specifies open files (in addition to
stdin/err/out) to be inherited by new process.</p>

<p>In the above code netListener is a pointer to
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/#Listener">net.Listener</a> listening for HTTP
requests. The <code>path</code> variable should contain the path to the new
executable (if you&#8217;re upgrading).</p>

<p>An important point in the above code is that <code>netListener.File()</code>
returns a
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/dup.html">dup(2)</a>
of the file descriptor. The duplicated file descriptor will not have
the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fcntl.html"><code>FD_CLOEXEC</code> flag</a> set,
which would cause the file to be closed in the child (not what we want).</p>

<p>You may come across examples that pass the inherited file descriptor
number to the child via a command line argument, but the way
<code>ExtraFiles</code> is implemented makes it unnecessary. The documentation
states that &#8220;If non-nil, entry i becomes file descriptor 3+i.&#8221; This
means that in the above code snippet, the inherited file descriptor in
the child will always be 3, thus no need to explicitely pass it.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>args</code> array contains a <code>-graceful</code> option: your program will
need some way of informing the child that this is a part of a graceful
restart and the child should re-use the socket rather than try opening
a new one. Another way to do this might be via an environment
variable.</p>

<h3>Signal parent to stop</h3>

<p>At this point we&#8217;re ready to accept requests, but just before we do
that, we need to tell our parent to stop accepting requests and exit,
which could be something like this:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>In-progress requests completion/timeout</h2>

<p>For this we will need to keep track of open connections with a
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup">sync.WaitGroup</a>. We will need
to increment the wait group on every accepted connection and decrement
it on every connection close.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='go'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">httpWg</span> <span class="nx">sync</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">WaitGroup</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At first glance, the Golang standard http package does not provide any
hooks to take action on Accept() or Close(), but this is where the
interface magic comes to the rescue. (Big thanks and credit to <a href="http://nella.org/jra/">Jeff R. Allen</a>
for <a href="http://blog.nella.org/zero-downtime-upgrades-of-tcp-servers-in-go/">this post</a>).</p>

<p>Here is an example of a listener which increments a wait group on
every Accept(). First, we &#8220;subclass&#8221; <code>net.Listener</code> (you&#8217;ll see why we
need <code>stop</code> and <code>stopped</code> below):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='go'><span class='line'><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="nx">gracefulListener</span> <span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">net</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Listener</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next we &#8220;override&#8221; the Accept method. (Nevermind <code>gracefulConn</code> for
now, it will be introduced later).</p>

<p>The reason the function above starts a goroutine is because this
cannot be done in our <code>Accept()</code> above since it will block on
<code>gl.Listener.Accept()</code>. The goroutine will unblock it by closing file
descriptor.</p>

<p>Our <code>Close()</code> method simply sends a <code>nil</code> to the stop channel for the
above goroutine to do the rest of the work.</p>

<p>And, of course we also need a variant of a

<p>To start using the above graceful version of the Listener, all we need
is to change the <code>server.Serve(l)</code> line to:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>And there is one more thing. You should avoid hanging connections that
the client has no intention of closing (or not this week). It is
better to create your server as follows:</p>

(in pre-release testing as of this writing) is currently the fastest tool when it

<h2>The point of this test</h2>

<p>I wanted to see how mod_python compares to other tools of similar
purpose on high-end hardware and with relatively high concurrency. As
I&#8217;ve <a href="http://grisha.org/blog/2013/10/10/mod-python-performance/">written before</a>
you&#8217;d be foolish to base your platform decision on these numbers
because speed in this case matters very little. So the point of this
is just make sure that mod_python is in the ballpark with the rest and
that there isn&#8217;t anything seriously wrong with it. And surprisingly,
mod_python is actually pretty fast, <em>fastest</em>, even, though in its own
category (a raw mod_python handler).</p>

<h2>Test rig</h2>

<p>The server is a 24-core Intel Xeon 3GHz with 64GB RAM, running Linux
2.6.32 (CentOS 6.3).</p>

<p>The testing was done with
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yarosla/httpress/wiki/Home">httpress</a>, which
was chosen after having tried
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html">ab</a>,
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/">httperf</a> and
<a href="http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/weighttp/wiki">weighttp</a>. The exact command was:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>httpress -n 5000000 -c 120 -t 8 -k http://127.0.0.1/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Concurrency of 120 was chosen as the highest number I could run across
all setups without getting strange errors. &#8220;Strange errors&#8221; could be
disconnects, delays and stuck connections, all tunable by anything
from Linux kernel configuration to specific tool configs. I very much
wanted concurrency to be at least a few times higher but it quickly
became apparent that getting to that level would require very
significant system tweaking for which I just didn&#8217;t have the time. 120
concurrent requests is nothing to sneeze at though: if you sustained
this rate for a day of python handler serving, you&#8217;d have processed
10,812,009,600 requests (on a single server!).</p>

<p>I should also note that in my tweaking of various configurations I
couldn&#8217;t get the requests/s numbers any significantly higher than what
you see above. Increasing concurrency and number of workers mostly
increased errors rather than r/s, which is also interesting because
it&#8217;s important how gracefuly each of these tools fails, but failure
mode is a whole different subject.</p>

<p>The tests were done via the loopback (127.0.0.1) because having tried
hitting the server from outside it became apparent that the network
was the bottleneck.</p>

<p>Keepalives were in use (-k), which means that all of the 5 million
requests are processed over only about fifty thousand TCP
connections. Without keepalives this would be more of the Linux kernel
test because the bulk of the work establishing and taking down a
connection happens in the kernel.</p>

<p>Before running the 5 million requests I ran 100,000 as a &#8220;warm up&#8221;.</p>

<p>This post does not include the actual code for the WSGI app and mod_python handlers because it was same as
in my <a href="http://grisha.org/blog/2013/10/10/mod-python-performance/">last post on mod_python performance testing</a>.</p>

<h2>Why httpress</h2>

<p><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html">ab</a> simply can&#8217;t run more than about 150K requests per second, so it
couldn&#8217;t adequately test nxweb and nginx static file serving.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/">httperf</a> looked
promising at first, but as is <a href="http://gwan.com/en_apachebench_httperf.html">noted here</a> its requests per
second cannot be trusted because it gradually increases the
load.</p>

<p><a href="http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/weighttp/wiki">weighttp</a> seemed
good, but somehow got stuck on idle but not yet closed connections
which affected the request/s negatively.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/yarosla/httpress/wiki/Home">httpress</a> claimed that it &#8220;promptly timeouts stucked connections,
forces all hanging connections to close after the main run, does not
allow hanging or interrupted connections to affect the measurement&#8221;,
which is just what I needed. And it worked really great too.</p>

<h2>The choice of contenders</h2>

<p>mod_python and mod_wsgi are the obvious choices, uWSGI/Nginx combo is
known as a low-resource and fast alternative. I came across nxweb
while looking at httpress (it&#8217;s written by the same person
(<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yarosla">Yaroslav Stavnichiy</a>), it looks to be the
fastest (open source) web server currently out there, faster than (closed source)
G-WAN, even.</p>

<h2>Specific tool notes</h2>

<p>The code used for testing and the configs were essentially same as what
I used in my <a href="http://grisha.org/blog/2013/10/10/mod-python-performance/">previous post on mod_python performance testing</a>.
The key differences are listed below.</p>

<h3>Apache</h3>

<p>The key config on Apache was:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ThreadsPerChild 25    # default
</span><span class='line'>StartServers 16
</span><span class='line'>MinSpareThreads 400</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>MinSpareThreads ensures that Apache starts all possible processes and
threads on startup (25 * 16 = 400) so that there is no ramp up
period and it&#8217;s tsunami-ready right away.</p>

<h3>uWSGI</h3>

<p>The comparison with uWSGI isn&#8217;t entriely appropriate because it was
running listening on a unix domain socket behind Nginx. The -p 16
&#8211;threads 1 (16 worker processes with a single thread each) was chosen
as the best performing option after some experimentation. Upping -p to
32 reduced r/s to 86233, 64 to 47296. Upping &#8211;threads to 2 (with 16
workers) reduced r/s to 55925 (by half, which is weird - mod_python has no
problems with 25 threads). &#8211;single-interpreter didn&#8217;t seem to have
any significant impact.</p>

<p>The actual uWSGI command was:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>uwsgi -s logs/uwsgi.sock --pp htdocs  -M -p 16 --threads 1 -w mp_wsgi -z 30 -l 120 -L</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A note on the uWSGI performance. Initially it seemed to be
outperforming the mod_python handler by nearly a factor of two. Then
after all kinds of puzzled head-scratching, I decided to verify that
every hit ran my Python code - I did this by writing a dot to a file
and making sure that the file size matches the number of hits in the
end. It turned out that about one third of the requests from Nginx to
uWSGI were erroring out, but httpress didn&#8217;t see them as errors. So if
you&#8217;re going to attempt to replicate this, watch out for this
condition. EDIT: Thanks to uWSGI&#8217;s author Roberto De Loris&#8217; help, it
turned out that this was a result of misconfiguration on my part - the
-l parameter should be set higher than 120. (This explains how I
arrived at 120 as the concurrency chosen for the test too). The
request/s number and uWSGI&#8217;s position in my table is still correct.</p>

<h3>Nginx</h3>

<p>The relevant parts of the nginx config were (Note: this is not the
complete config for brevity):</p>

</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Mod_python is plenty fast. Considering that unlike with other
contenders large parts of the code are written in Python and thus are
readable and debuggable by not just C programmers, it&#8217;s quite a feat.</p>

<p>I was surprised by Apache&#8217;s slow static file serving compared to Nginx
and Nxweb (the latter, although still young and in development seems like a
very cool web server).</p>

<p>On the other hand I am not all that convinced that the Nginx/uWSGI set
up is as cool as it is touted everywhere. Unquestionably Nginx is a
super solid server and Apache has some catching up to do when it comes
to acting as a static file server or a reverse proxy. But when it
comes to serving Python-generated content, my money would be on Apache
rather than uWSGI. The &#8220;low&#8221; 120 concurrency level for this test was
largely chosen because of uWSGI (Apache started going haywire on me at
about 400+ concurrent connections). EDIT: Thanks to Roberto&#8217;s comment,
this turned out to be an error on my part (see comments). uWSGI can
handle higher concurrencies if -l is set higher.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also interesting that on my laptop a mod_python handler
outperformed the Apache static file, but it wasn&#8217;t the case on the big
server.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t do Python 3 testing, it would be interesting to see how much
difference it makes as well.</p>

<p>I realize this post may be missing key config data - I had to leave
out a lot because of time contraints (and my lazyness) - so if you see
any obvious gaps, please comment, I will try to address them.</p>

<p>P.S. Did I mention mod_python 3.5 supports Python 3? Please help
me <a href="https://github.com/grisha/mod_python/issues/9">test it</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you in favor of a single request object, or two separate objects:
request and response?  Could it be that the two options are not
contradictory or even mutually exclusive?</p>

<p>I thouhgt I always was in favor of a single request object which I
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2003-October/000162.html">expressed on the Web-SIG mailing list thread</a>
dating back to October 2003 (ten years ago!). But it is only now that
I’ve come to realize that both proponents of a single object and two
separate objects were correct, they were just talking about different
things.</p>

<p>The confusion lies in the distinction between what I am going to term
a web application and a request handler.</p>

<p>A <em>request handler</em> exists in the realm of an HTTP server, which
(naturally) serves HTTP requests. An HTTP request consists of a
request (a method, such as “GET”, along with some HTTP headers and
possibly a body) and a response (a status line, some HTTP headers and
possibly a body) sent over the TCP connection. There is a one-to-one
correspondence between a request and a response established by the
commonality of the connection. An HTTP request is incomplete if the
response is missing, and a response cannot exist without a
request. (Yes, the term &#8220;request&#8221; is used to denote both the request
and response, as well as just the request part of the request, and
that&#8217;s confusing).</p>

<p>A <em>web application</em> is a layer on top of the HTTP request handler. A web
application operates in requests and responses as well, but those
should not be confused with the HTTP request/response pairs.</p>

<p>Making the conceptual distinction between a web application request
and an HTTP request is difficult because both web applications and
request handlers use HTTP headers and status to accomplish their
objectives. The difference is that strictly speaking a web application
does not have to use HTTP and ideally should be protocol-agnostic,
though it is very common for a web application to rely on
HTTP-specific features these days. Not every HTTP request exists as
part of a web application. But because it is difficult to imagine a
web application without HTTP, we tend to lump the two concepts
together. It is also exacerbated by the fact that HTTP headers carry
both application-specific and HTTP-specific information.</p>

<p>A good example of the delineation between a web application response
and an HTTP response is handling of an error condition. A web
application error is typically not an HTTP error.  Imagine an “invalid
login” page. It is a web application error, but not an HTTP error. An
“invalid login” page should send a “200 OK” status line and a body
explaining that the credentials supplied were not valid. But then HTTP
provides its own authentication mechanism, and an HTTP “401
Unauthorized” (which ought not be used by web applications) is often
misunderstood as something that web applications should incorporate
into how they do things.</p>

<p>Another example of a place where the line gets blurry is a redirect. A
redirect is quite common in a web application, and it is typically
accomplished by way of an HTTP redirect (3XX status code), yet the two
are not the same. An HTTP redirect, for example, may happen
unbeknownst to the web application for purely infrastructural reasons,
and a web application redirect does not always cause an HTTP redirect.</p>

<p>Yet another example: consider a website serving static content where
same URI responds with different content according to the
Accept-Language header in the request. Is this a “web application”?
Hardly. Could you have some Python (or whatever you favorite language
is) help along with this process? Certainly. Wouldn’t this code be
part of a “web application”?  Good question. It is not uncommon for a
web application to consider the Accept-Language header in its
response. You could also accomplish this entirely in an http server by
configuring it correctly. Sometimes whether something is a web
application just depends on how you&#8217;re looking at it, but you do have
to decide for yourself which it is.</p>

<p>Getting to the original problem, the answer to the question of whether
to use separate response/request objects or not depends very much on
which realm you’re operating in. A request handler only needs one
request object representing the HTTP request because it is
conceptually similar to a file - you don’t typically open a file twice
once for reading and once for writing. Whereas a web application,
which may chose between different responses depending on what’s in the
request is possibly best served with two separate objects.</p>

<p>I think that misunderstanding of what a “web application” is happens
to be the cause of a lot of bad decisions plaguing the world of web
development these days. It is not uncommon to see people get stuck on
low-level HTTP subtleties while referring to web application issues and
vise-versa. We’d all get along better if we took some time to think
about the distinction between web applications and HTTP request
handlers.</p>

<p>P.S. This will get even more complicated when HTTP 2.0 comes around
where responses may exist without a request. And I haven’t even
mentioned SSL/TLS.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not very fond of it. Here is why.</p>

<h2>CGI Origins</h2>

<p>WSGI is based on CGI, as the &#8220;GI&#8221; (Gateway Interface) suggests right
there in the name.</p>

<p>CGI solved a very important problem using the very limited tools at
hand available at the time. Though CGI wasn&#8217;t a standard, it was
ubiquitous in the early days of the WWW, despite its inherent slowness
and other limitations. It became popular because it worked with any
language, was easy to turn on and provided such a thick wall of
isolation that admins could turn it on for their users without too much concern
for problems caused by user-generated CGI scripts.</p>

<p>There is now an RFC (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875">RFC3875</a>)
describing CGI, but I hazard that
<a href="http://ken.coar.org/">Ken Coar</a> wrote the RFC not because he thought CGI was great, but rather
out of discontent with the present state of affairs - everyone was
using CGI, yet there never was a formal document describing it.</p>

<p>So if I were to attempt to unite all Python web applications under the
same standard, CGI wouldn&#8217;t be the first thing I would consider. There are
other efforts at solving the same problem in more elegant ways which
could be used as a model, e.g. (dare I mention?) Java Servlets.</p>

<h2>Headers</h2>

<p>CGI dictated that HTTP headers be passed to the CGI script by way of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">environment variables</a>. The
same environment that contain your <code>$PATH</code> and <code>$TERM</code>.  (Note this
also explains the origin of the term <em>environment</em> in WSGI - in HTTP
there is no <em>request environment</em>, there is simply a <em>request</em>). So as
to not clash with any other environment variables, CGI would prepend
<code>HTTP_</code> to every header name. It also swapped dashes with underscores
because dashes are not allowed in shell variable names. And because
environment variables in DOS and Unix are typically case-insensitive,
they were capitalized. Thus <code>"content-type"</code> would become <code>"HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE"</code>.</p>

<p>And how much sense applying the same transformation make in the realm
in which WSGI operates? The headers are typically read by the
webserver and stored in some kind of a structure, which ought to be
directly accessible so the application can get headers in the
original, unmodified format. For example in Apache this would be the
<code>req.headers_in</code> table.  What is the benefit of combing through that
structure converting every key to some capitalized HTTP_ string at
every request? Why are WSGI developers forced to use
<code>env['HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH']</code> rather than <code>env['Content-length']</code>?</p>

<p>Another thing about the environment is that the WSGI standard states
that it must be a real Python dictionary, thereby dictating that a
memory allocation happen to satisfy this requirement, <em>at every
request</em>.</p>

<h2>start_response()</h2>

<p>In order to be able to write anything to the client a WSGI application
must envoke the start_response() function passed to it which would
return a write() method.</p>

<p>Ten points for cuteness here, but the practicality of this solution
eludes me. This is certainly a clever way to make the fact that the start
of a response is an irreversible action in HTTP because the headers are
sent first, but seriosly - do programmers who code at this level not
know it? Why can&#8217;t the header sending part happen implicitly at the
first write(), and why can&#8217;t an application write without sending any
headers?</p>

<p>There is also another problem here - function calls are relatively
expensive in Python. The requirement that the app must beg for the
write object every time introduces a completely unnecessary function
call.</p>

<p>The request object with a write() method should simply be passed
in. This is how it has always worked in mod_python (cited in PEP3333 a
number of times!).</p>

<h2>Error handling</h2>

<p>First, I must confess that after re-reading the section of the PEP3333
describing the <code>exc_info</code> argument several times I still can&#8217;t say I
grok what it&#8217;s saying. Looking at some implementations out there I am
releived to know I am not the only one.</p>

<p>But the gist of it that an exception can be supplied along with some
headers. It seems to me there is confusion between HTTP errors and
Python errors here, the two are not related. What is the expected
outcome of passing a Python exception to an HTTP server? The server
would probably convert it to a 500 Internal Server Error (well it only
has so many possibilities to chose from), and what&#8217;s the point of that?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t the outcome be same if the application simply raised an
exception?</p>

<p>If the spec wanted to provide means for the application Python errors
to somehow map to HTTP errors, why not define a special exception
class which could be used to send HTTP errors? What was wrong with
mod_python&#8217;s:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>raise apache.SERVER_RETURN, apache.HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I think it&#8217;s simple and self-explanatory.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>

<p>What is <code>wsgi.run_once</code>, why does it matter and why should the web
server provide it? What would be a good use case for such a thing?</p>

<p>There is a long section describing &#8220;middleware&#8221;. Middleware is a
wrapper, an example of the <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/ParallelPatterns/PatternLanguage/AlgorithmStructure/Pipeline.htm">pipeline design pattern</a>
and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything special with this concept that
the WSGI spec should even mention it. (I also object to the term
&#8220;middleware&#8221; - my intuition suggests it&#8217;s a layer between &#8220;hardware&#8221;
and &#8220;software&#8221;, not a wrapper.)</p>

<h2>SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most annoying part of CGI were these two mis-understood
variables, and sadly WSGI uses them too.</p>

<p>Remember that in CGI we always had a script. A typical CGI script
resided somewhere on the filesystem to which the request URI maps. As
part of serving the request the server traversed the URI mapping each
element to an element of the filesystem path to locate the
script. Once the script was found, the portion of the URI used thus far
was assigned to the SCRIPT_NAME variable, while the remainder of the
URI got assigned to PATH_INFO.</p>

<p>But where is <em>the script</em> in WSGI? Is my Python module the script?
What relatioship does there exist between the request URI and the
(non-existent) script?</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>I am not convinced that there should be a universal standard for
Python web applications to begin with. I think that what we refer to
as &#8220;web applications&#8221; is still not very well understood by us
programmers.</p>

<p>But if we are to have one, I think that WSGI approach is not the right
one. It brings the world of Python web development to the lowest
common denominator - CGI and introduces some problems of its own on
top of it.</p>

<h2>Other notes</h2>

<h3>What is the Gateway in CGI</h3>

<p>I did some digging into the etymology of “Common Gateway Interface”,
because I wanted to know what the original author (Rob McCool) meant
by it when he came up with it. From reading <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100127191128/http://hoohoo.ncsa.illinois.edu/cgi/intro.html">this</a>
it’s apparent that he saw it as the Web daemon’s gateway to an outside
program:</p>

<p>“For example, let&#8217;s say that you wanted to &#8220;hook up&#8221; your Unix
database to the World Wide Web, to allow people from all over the
world to query it. Basically, you need to create a CGI program that
the Web daemon will execute to transmit information to the database
engine, and receive the results back again and display them to the
client. This is an example of a gateway, and this is where CGI,
currently version 1.1, got its origins.”</p>

<p>I always perceived it the other way around, I thought the “gateway”
was a gateway to the web server. I think that when Phillip J. Eby
first proposed the name WSGI he was under the same misperception as I.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This story started back in 1996. I was in my early twenties, working
as a programmer at a small company specializing in on-line reporting of
certain pharmaceutical data.</p>

<p>There was a web-based application (which was extremely cool
considering how long ago this was), but unfortunately it was written
in Visual Basic by a contractor and I was determined to do something
about it. As was very fashionable at the time, I was very pro Open
Source, had Linux running on my home 386 and had recently heard
<a href="http://boston-linux-unix-general-discussion-list.996279.n3.nabble.com/fwd-LOCAL-Washington-DC-Linux-User-Group-meeting-and-Python-talk-td3733.html">Guido’s talk</a>
at the DC Linux user group presenting his new language he called
Python. Python seemed like a perfect alternative to the VB
monstrosity.</p>

<p>I spent a few weeks quietly in my cubicle learning Python and
rewriting the whole app in it. (Back in those days this is how
programmers worked, there was no “agile” and “daily stand ups”,
everyone understood that things take time. I miss those days very
much). Python was fantastic, and soon the app was completely
re-written.</p>

<p>Then I realized that explaining what I’ve been working on to my bosses
might be a bit of a challenge. You see, for a while there nobody knew
that the web app they’ve been using had been re-written in Python, but
sooner or later I would have to reveal the truth and, more
importantly, justify my decision. I needed a good reason, and stuff
about object-oriented programming, clean code, open source, etc would
have fallen on deaf ears.</p>

<p>Just around that time the Internet Programming with Python book came
out, and in it there was a chapter on how to embed the Python
interpreter in the Netscape Enterprise web server. The idea seemed
very intriguing to me and it might have contained exactly the
justification I was looking for - it would make the app
faster. (&#8220;Faster&#8221; is nearly as good as &#8220;cheaper&#8221; when it comes to
selling to the management). I can’t say that I knew much C back then,
but with enough tinkering around I was able to make something work,
and lo and behold it was quite noticeably faster.</p>

<p>And so a few days later I held a presentation in the big conference
room regarding this new tool we’ve started using called Python which
can crunch yall’s numbers an order of magnitude faster than the
Microsoft product we’ve been using. And oh, by the way, I quickly
hacked something together last night - let’s do a live demo, look how
fast this is!  They were delighted.</p>

<p>Little did they know, the app had been running in Python for months,
and the reason for the speed up had little to do with the language
itself. It was all because I was able to embed the interpreter within
the web server. Then I thought that to make it all complete I would
make my little tool open source and put it on my website free for
everyone to use. I called it
<a href="http://www.ispol.com/home/grisha/nsapy/">NSAPy</a> as a combination of
the Netscape Server API and Python.</p>

<p>But I didn’t stop there, and soon I was able to replicate this on an
Apache web server, which was taking the Internet by storm back
then. The name mod_python came naturally since there already was a
mod_perl.</p>

<p>Things were going very well back then. These were the late nineties,
the dawn of e-commerce on the World Wide Web. I started working for a
tiny ISP which soon transformed into a humongous Web Hosting company,
we ran millions of sites, built new data centers with thousands of
servers pushing gigabits of traffic and (in short) were taking over
the world (or so it seemed). With the rise of our company’s stock
price, me and my colleagues were on our way to becoming
millionaires. Mod_python was doing very well too. It had a busy
website, a large and very active mailing list and an ever growing
number of devoted users. I went to various Open Source conferences to
present about it (and couldn’t really believe that without exception
everyone knew what mod_python was).</p>

<p>Then came 2001. We just bought a house and our second son was not even
a year old when one beautiful sunny summer day I was summoned to a
mandatory meeting. In that meeting about two thirds of our office was
let go. Even though we all felt it was coming, it was still a shock. I
remember coming home that morning and having to explain my wife that
I’d just been fired. This after constant all-nighters, neglect for
family life under the excuse of having the most important job doing
the most important thing and changing the world and rants about how
we’d be all set financially in just a year or two. In my personally
opinion the 2007 financial crash was nothing compared to the dot-com
bust. Everyone was getting laid off everywhere, the Internet became a
dirty word, software development was being outsourced to India.</p>

<p>For the next couple of years I made a living doing contracting work
here and there. Needless to say, mod_python wasn’t exactly at the top
of my priority list. But it was getting ever more popular, the mailing
list busier, though it didn’t make any money (for me at least). I
tried my best to keep everything running in whatever spare time I had,
answering emails and releasing new versions periodically. Finding time
for it was increasingly difficult, especially given that most of the
work I was doing had nothing to do with mod_python or Python.</p>

<p>One day I had this thought that donating mod_python to the Apache
Software Foundation would ensure its survival, even if I can no longer
contribute. And so it was done. Initially things went very well - the
donation did affiliate mod_python with the solid reputation of Apache
and that was great. Mod_python gained a multitude more users and most
importantly contributors.</p>

<p>At the same time my life was becoming ever more stressful. Free time
for mod_python hacking was getting more and more scarce until there
was none. I also think I was experiencing burnout. Answering questions
on the mailing list became an annoyance. I had to read through
enormous threads with proposals for various features or how things
ought to work and respond to them, and it was just never ending. It
wasn’t fun anymore.</p>

<p>I also felt that people didn’t understand what mod_python was and that
I’m not able to explain it very well. (For what it’s worth, I still
feel this way). In my mind it was primarily an interface to the Apache
internals, but since making every structure and API accessible from
within Python was impractical, only selected pieces were
exposed. Secondly, mod_python provided means to perform certain things
that were best done in Apache, e.g. global locking, caching. Lastly,
it provided certain common tasks but implemented in Apache-specific
ways (using Apache pools, APR, etc.) for maximal performance; things
like cookies and sessions fell into that category. Publisher and PSP
didn’t strictly belong in mod_python, but were there for the sake of
battery-includedness - you could build a rudimentary app without any
additional tool.</p>

<p>The rest of the world saw it as a web-development framework. It wasn’t
a particularly good one, especially when it came to development,
because it required root privileges to run. It also didn’t do a very
good job at reloading changed modules very well which complicated
development. A very considerable effort was put in by one of the
contributors to address the particular issue of module loading and
caching, and I never thought it to be important because to me
restarting Apache seemed like the answer, I didn’t think that people
without root access would ever use mod_python.</p>

<p>As I was growing more disinterested in mod_python it got to a point
where I just let it be. I would skim through emails from people I
trusted and responded affirmatively to whatever they proposed without
giving it much thought. I didn’t see any point in keeping and
defending my vision for mod_python. I think that by about 2006 or so I
was so disconnected I no longer had a good grasp of what the latest
features of mod_python were being worked on. Not sure if it was my
lack of interest or that other contributors felt burned out as well,
but new commits slowed down to a trickle and stopped eventually, and
my quarterly reports to the ASF Board became a cut-and-paste email of
“no new activity”.</p>

<p>This is where the negative aspect of the ASF patronage begun to
surface. Sadly, the ASF rules are that projects and their community
must be active, and soon the project got moved to the attic. And even
though I kept telling myself that I couldn’t care less, I must admit
it hurt. The attic is a like a one-way trash can - once there, a
project cannot go back, other than through the incubation process.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2013. Why get back to hacking on it? First of all I
got tired of “mod_python is dead” plastered all over the web.  Every
time I see some kid who wasn’t old enough to speak back when I first
released it tweet that it is this or that, I can’t help but take it a
little personally. It’s an open source project people, it’s only dead
if you do not contribute to it.</p>

<p>For the skeptics in the crowd I most certainly disagree that
mod_python as a concept is dead, I’d even argue that its time hasn’t
come yet. The vision has not changed. Mod_python is still an interface
to Apache which lets you take advantage of its versatile architecture
to do some very powerful things. It’s not quite a web development
framework, and it’s not even a tool for running your favorite web
development framework in production (though it can certainly do that
quite nicely).</p>

<p>These days there is more demand than ever for high volume servers that
do not have a user interface and thus do not need a WSGI framework to
power them - I think this is one of the areas where mod_python could
be most useful. There are also all kinds of possibilities for using
Apache and mod_python for distributed computing and big data stuff
taking advantage of the fact that Apache is an excellent job
supervisor - anyone up for writing a map/reduce framework in
mod_python?</p>

<p>I must also note that hacking on it in the past weeks has been fun
once again. I wanted to get up to speed with the latest on Python 3
and Apache internals, especially the event/epoll stuff and this has
been a great way to do just that. I also very much enjoy that I can
once again do whatever I want without any scrutiny.</p>

<p>If there is one thing I’ve learned it’s that few open source projects
can exist without their founders’ continuous involvement. The Little
Prince once said - “You become responsible forever for what you have
tamed”. It seems like mod_python is my rose and if I don’t water it,
no one will.</p>

<p>P.S. Did I mention mod_python now supports Python 3? Please help
me <a href="https://github.com/grisha/mod_python/issues/9">test it</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>TL;DR: mod_python is faster than you think.</em></p>

<p>Tonight I thought I&#8217;d spend some time looking into how the new
<a href="http://www.modpython.org/">mod_python</a>
fares against other frameworks of similar purpose. In this article I
am going to show the results of my findings, and then I will explain
<em>why it really does not matter</em>.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a pure mod_python handler, because this is as fast as mod_python gets.</li>
<li>a mod_python wsgi app, because WSGI is so popular these days.</li>
<li>mod_wsgi, because it too runs under Apache and is written entirely in C.</li>
<li>uWSGI, because it claims to be super fast.</li>
<li>Apache serving a static file (as a point of reference).</li>
</ul>


<h1>The Test</h1>

<p>I am testing this on a CentOS instance running inside VirtualBox on an
early 2011 MacBook Pro. The VirtualBox has 2 CPU&#8217;s and 6GB of RAM
allocated to it. Granted this configuration can&#8217;t possibly be very
performant [if there is such a word], but it should be enough to
compare.</p>

<p>Real-life performance is very much affected by issues related to
concurrency and load. I don&#8217;t have the resources or tools to
comprehensively test such scenarios, and so I&#8217;m just using concurrency
of 1 and seeing how fast each of the afore-listed set ups can process
small requests.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using mod_python 3.4.1 (pre-release), revision
<a href="https://github.com/grisha/mod_python/tree/35f35dc2a8d23e92e5c8dc7dccea2a1b6bcc353e">35f35dc</a>,
compiled against Apache 2.4.4 and Python 2.7.5. Version of mod_wsgi is
3.4, for uWSGI I use 1.9.17.1.</p>

<p>The Apache configuration is pretty minimal (It could probably trimmed
even more, but this is good enough):</p>

<p>I should note that <code>&lt;Location /&gt;</code> is there for a purpose - the latest
mod_python forgoes the map_to_storage phase when inside a <code>&lt;Location&gt;</code>
section, so this makes it a little bit faster.</p>

<p>And the <code>mp.py</code> file referred to by the <code>PythonHandler</code> in the config
above looks like this:</p>

<p>As the benchmark tool, I&#8217;m using the good old

<p>For each test in this article I run 500 requests first as a &#8220;warm up&#8221;,
then another 500K for the actual measurement.</p>

<p>For the mod_python WSGI handler test I use the following config (relevant section):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For mod_wsgi test I use the exact same file, and the config as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For uWSGI (I am not an expert), I first used the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which yielded a pretty dismal result, so I tried using a unix socket
<code>-s /home/grisha/mp_test/uwsgi.sock</code> and ngnix as
the front end as described
<a href="http://nichol.as/benchmark-of-python-web-servers">here</a>, which did
make uWSGI come out on top (even if proxied uWSGI is an orange among
the apples).</p>

<h3>The results, requests per second, fastest at the top:</h3>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting and unexpected at first is that uWSGI and the
mod_python handler perform better than sending a static file, which I
expected to be the fastest. On a second thought though it does make
sense, once you consider that no (on average pretty expensive)
filesystem operations are performed to serve the request.</p>

<p>Mod_wsgi performs better than the mod_python WSGI handler, and that is
expected, because the mod_python version is mostly Python, vs
mod_wsgi&#8217;s C version.</p>

<p>I think that with a little work mod_python wsgi handler could perform
on par with uWSGI, though I&#8217;m not sure the effort would be worth
it. Because as we all know,
<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth#Computer_Programming_as_an_Art_.281974.29">premature optimization is the root of all evil</a>.</p>

<h1>Why It Doesn&#8217;t Really Matter</h1>

<p>Having seen the above you may be tempted to jump on the uWSGI wagon,
because after all, what matters more than speed?</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s imagine a more real world scenario, because it&#8217;s not likely
that all your application does is send <code>"Hello World!".</code></p>

<p>To illustrate the point a little better I created a very simple Django
app, which too sends <code>"Hello World!"</code>, only it does it using a template:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;hello.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Context</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s">&#39;name&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">&#39;World&#39;</span><span class="p">})</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">HttpResponse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using the mod_python wsgi handler (the slowest), we can process 455
req/s, using uWSGI (the fastest) 474. This means that by moving this
&#8220;application&#8221; from mod_pyhton to uWSGI we would improve performance by
a measley 5%.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s add some database action to our so-called &#8220;application&#8221;. For
every request I&#8217;m going to pull my user record from the Django
auth_users table:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.contrib.auth.models</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">User</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">HttpResponse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we are down to 237 req/s for the mod_python WSGI handler and 245
req/s in uWSGI, and the difference between the two has shrunk to just
over 3%.</p>

<p>Mind you, our &#8220;application&#8221; still has less than 10 lines of code. In a
real-world situation the difference in performance is more likely to
amount to less than a tenth of a percent.</p>

<p>Bottom line: it&#8217;s foolish to pick your web server based on speed
alone. Factors such as your comfort level with using it, features,
documentation, security, etc., are far more important than how fast it
can crank out &#8220;Hello world!&#8221;.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, mod_python 3.4.1 (used in this article) is
ready for pre-release testing, please help me <a href="https://github.com/grisha/mod_python/issues/8">test it</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step">&#8220;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step&#8221;</a></em></p>

<p>Most of my journeys never begin, or cannot continue because of that one
single step, be it first or next. Because it is hard, at times
excruciatingly so.</p>

<p>Here I speak of software, but this applies to many other aspects of my
life just as well.</p>

<p>I recon it&#8217;s because I do not think in steps. I think of a
destination.  I imagine the end-result. I can picture it with clarity
and in great detail. I know where I need to be. But what is the next
step to get there? And it doesn&#8217;t help that where I travel, there are
no signs.</p>

<p>The problem of deciding what to do next is so common for me that I
even have a name for it. I call it &#8220;The Next Smallest Step&#8221;
problem. Whenever I find myself idling, clicking over to online
time-wasters, I pause and ask myself &#8220;What is the Next Smallest Step?
What&#8217;s the next smallest thing I can do, right now?&#8221;</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much further this small step moves me. A
nanometer is better than standing still. It has to be something that
is simple enough that I can just do. Right now.</p>

<p>I always plan to do big things that take days, weeks or months. But of
all that, can I pick that one small simple and quick thing that I can
do now?</p>

<p>Sometimes focusing on the next smallest step is so difficult that I
pencil this question on a piece of paper, and sometimes I just type it
on the command line or in the source code. My short version is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>bash: WHAT: <span class="nb">command </span>not found
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(that&#8217;s right, in CAPS)</p>

<p>This simple question has taken me on some of the most fascinating and
challenging journeys ever. In restrospect, I think I would not be able
to travel any of them without repeatedly asking it of myself, over and
over again.</p>

<p>It has resulted in most productive and gratifying days of work. Some
of my greatest projects began with this question. In many instances it
established what I had to do for months ahead (years, even?). All
beginning with this one small question.</p>

<p>Conversely <em>not</em> asking it often enough, if at all, led to time having
gone by without any results to show for and many a great opportunity
lost.</p>

<p>I must also note that some of my next smallest steps took days of
thinking to figure out. Nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>And so I thought I&#8217;d share this with you, just in case you might find
it helpful. Whenever you find yourself at an impass and progress
has stopped, ask yourself:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the Next Smallest Step?&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nearly eight years after my last <a href="https://github.com/grisha/mod_python/commit/726e2697c0547dbbb4b09ce3348f76118bb911c4">commit</a>
to <a href="http://www.modpython.org/">Mod_python</a> I&#8217;ve decided to spend some time hacking on it again.</p>

<p>Five years without active development and thirteen since its first
release, it still seems to me an entirely useful and viable tool. The
code is exceptionally clean, the documentation is amazing, and the
test suite is awesome.  Which is a real testament to the noble efforts
of all the people who contributed to its development.</p>

<p>We live in this new
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">c10k</a> world now where
Apache Httpd no longer has the market dominance it once enjoyed, while
the latest Python web frameworks run without requiring or recommending
Mod_python. My hunch, however, is that given a thorough dusting it
could be quite useful (perhaps more than ever) and applied in very
interesting ways to solve the new problems. I also think the Python
language is at a very important inflection point. Pyhton 3 is now
mature, and is slowly but steadily becoming the preferred language of
many interesting communities such as data science, for example.</p>

<p>The current status of Mod_python as an Apache project is that it&#8217;s
in the <a href="http://attic.apache.org/">attic</a>. This means that the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">ASF</a> isn&#8217;t providing much in the way of
infrastructure support any longer, nor will you see an &#8220;official&#8221; ASF
release any time soon. (If ever - Mod_python would have to re-enter as
an <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubator</a> project and at this point
it is entirely premature to even consider such an option).</p>

<p>For now the main goal is to re-establish the community, and as part of
that I will have to sort out how to do issue tracking, discussion
groups, etc. At this point the only thing I&#8217;ve decided is that the
main repository will live on
<a href="https://github.com/grisha/mod_python">github</a>.</p>

<p>The latest code is in <a href="https://github.com/grisha/mod_python/tree/4.0.x">4.0.x branch</a>.  My initial
development goal is to bring it up to compatibility with Python 2.7
and Apache Httpd 2.4 (I&#8217;m nearly there already), then potentially move
on to Python 3 support. I have rolled back a few commits (most notably
the new importer) because I did not understand them. There are still a
few changes in Apache 2.4 that need to be addressed, but they seem
relatively minor at this point. Authentication has been changed
significantly in 2.4, though mod_python never had much coverage in that
area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you embark on converting vast quantities of JSON to Avro, you soon
discover that things are not as simple as they seem. Here is how it might happen.</p>

<p>A quick Google
search eventually leads you to the
<a href="http://www.us.apache.org/dist/avro/avro-1.7.4/java/avro-tools-1.7.4.jar">avro-tools</a>
jar, and you find yourself attempting to convert some JSON, such as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;first&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;middle&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;X&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;last&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;Doe&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;first&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;Jane&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;last&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;Doe&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Having read Avro documentation and being the clever being that you are, you start out with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>java -jar ~/src/avro/java/avro-tools-1.7.4.jar fromjson input.json --schema <span class="se">\</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">             {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;middle&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;},</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">             {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;last&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;}]}&#39;</span> &gt; output.avro
</span><span class='line'>Exception in thread <span class="s2">&quot;main&quot;</span> org.apache.avro.AvroTypeException: Expected field name not found: middle

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A brief moment of disappointment is followed by the bliss of
enlightment: Duh, the &#8220;middle&#8221; element needs a default! And so you try
again, this time having tacked on a default to the definition of &#8220;middle&#8221;, so it looks like <code>{"name":"middle","type":"string","default":""}</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Why doesn&#8217;t this work? Well&#8230; You don&#8217;t understand Avro, as it turns
out. You see, JSON is <em>not</em> Avro, and therefore the wonderful <em>Schema
Resolution</em> thing you&#8217;ve been reading about does not apply.</p>

<p>But do not despair. I wrote a tool just for you:</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/grisha/json2avro">json2avro</a>. It does exactly what you want:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>json2avro input.json output.avro -s <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="s1">&#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;record&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;whatever&quot;,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">   &quot;fields&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;first&quot;, &quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;},</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">             {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;middle&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;default&quot;:&quot;&quot;},</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">             {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;last&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;}]}&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>No errors, and we have an <code>output.avro</code> file, let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s in it by using the aforementioned avro-tools:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>java -jar ~/src/avro/java/avro-tools-1.7.4.jar tojson output.avro
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;first&quot;</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;John&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;middle&quot;</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;X&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;last&quot;</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;Doe&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;first&quot;</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;Jane&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;middle&quot;</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;last&quot;</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;Doe&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let me also mention that json2avro is written in C and is <em>fast</em>, it
supports Snappy, Deflate and LZMA compression codecs, lets you pick a
custom block size and is smart enough to (optionally) skip over lines
it cannot parse.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <p>I started programming professionally back when I was a teenager.
  I&#8217;ve spent most of my early career working at large ISP&#8217;s solving industrial-scale hosting challenges. Since around 2009 I&#8217;ve become more intersted in and now work exclusively on &#8220;Big Data&#8221; type stuff.</p>
  <p>I was born and grew up in Moscow, Russia, though I&#8217;ve lived in the Washington, DC (USA) area for more than half of my life now. Our kids were born and go to school here, it&#8217;s gradually become home for us.</p>
