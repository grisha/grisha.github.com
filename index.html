  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is part 4. See <a href="/blog/2017/04/27/simplistic-go-web-app/">part 1</a>,
<a href="/blog/2017/04/28/simplistic-go-web-app-part-2/">part 2</a> and
<a href="/blog/2017/05/01/go-web-app-part-3/">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>In this part I will try to briefly go over the missing pieces in our
very simplistic Go Web App.</p>

<h3 id="http-handler-wrappers">HTTP Handler Wrappers</h3>

<p>I tiny rant: I do not like the word “middleware”. The concept of a
wrapper has been around since the dawn of computing, there is no need
to invent new words for it.</p>

<p>Having that out of the way, let’s say we need to require
authentication for a certain URL. This is what our index handler
presently looks like:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="go"><span class="line"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">indexHandler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">model</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Model</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Handler</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">HandlerFunc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">w</span> <span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ResponseWriter</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">r</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Request</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">w</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">indexHTML</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="p">})</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>We could write a function which takes an <code>http.Handler</code> as an argument
and returns a (different) <code>http.Handler</code>. The returned handler checks
whether the user is authenticated with <code>m.IsAuthenticated()</code> (whatever
it does is not important here) and redirects the user to a login page,
or executes the original handler by calling its <code>ServeHTTP()</code> method.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">	<span class="p">})</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Given the above, the function registration now would look like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="go"><span class="line">   <span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">requireLogin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">indexHandler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">)),</span> <span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Handlers can be wrapped this way in as many layers as needed and this
approach is very flexible. Anything from setting headers to
compressing output can be accomplished via a wrapper. Note also that
we can pass in whatever arguments we need, for example our
<code>*model.Model</code>.</p>

<h3 id="url-parameters">URL Parameters</h3>

<p>Sooner or later we might want to rely on URL parameters,
e.g. <code>/person/3</code> where <code>3</code> is a person id. Go standard library doesn’t
provide any support for this leaving it as an exercise for the
developer. The software component responsible for this sort of thing
is known as a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux">Mux</a> or
“router” and it can be replaced by a custom implementation. A Mux also
provides a <code>ServeHTTP()</code> method which means it satisfies the
<code>http.Handler</code> interface, i.e. it is a handler.</p>

<p>A very popular implementation is the <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/mux">Gorilla Mux</a>.
It is easy to delegate entire
sub-urls to the Gorilla Mux wherever more flexibility is needed. For
example we can decide that everything from <code>/person</code> and below is
handled by an instance of a Gorilla router <em>and</em> we want that to be
all authenticated, which might look like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>NB: I found that trailing slashes are important and the rules on when
they are required are a bit confusing.</p>

<p>There are many other router/mux implementations out there, the beauty
of not buying into any kind of a framework is that we can choose the
one that works best for us or write our own (they are not difficult
to implement).</p>

<h3 id="asset-handling">Asset Handling</h3>

<p>One of the neatest things about Go is that a compiled program is a
single binary not a big pile of files like it is with most scripting
languages and even compiled ones. But if our program relies on assets
(JS, CSS, image and other files), we would need to copy those over to
the server at deployment time.</p>

<p>There is a way we can preserve the “one binary” characteristic of
our program by including assets as part of the binary itself. For
that there is the <a href="https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/">go-bindata</a> project and its
nephew <a href="github.com/elazarl/go-bindata-assetfs">go-bindata-assetfs</a>.</p>

<p>Since packing assets into the binary is slightly beyond what
<code>go build</code> can accomplish, we will need some kind of a script to take care of it.
My personal preference is to use the tried and true <code>make</code>, and it
is not uncommon to see Go projects come with a <code>Makefile</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a relevant example Makefile rule</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="sh"><span class="line"><span class="nv">ASSETS_DIR</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;assets&quot;</span>
</span><span class="line">build:
</span><span class="line">	@export <span class="nv">GOPATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$$</span><span class="o">{</span>GOPATH-~/go<span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class="line">	go get github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/... github.com/elazarl/go-bindata-assetfs/... <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="nv">$$</span>GOPATH/bin/go-bindata -o bindata.go -tags builtinassets <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">ASSETS_DIR</span><span class="k">}</span>/... <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class="line">	go build -tags builtinassets -ldflags <span class="s2">&quot;-X main.builtinAssets=${ASSETS_DIR}&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The above rule creates a <code>bindata.go</code> file which will be placed in the
same directory where <code>main.go</code> is and becomes part of package
<code>main</code>. <code>main.go</code> will somehow know that assets are built-in and this
is accomplished via an <code>-ldflags "-X main.builtinAssets=${ASSETS_DIR}"</code> trick,
which is a way to assign values to variables at compile time. This means
that our code can now check for the value of <code>builtinAssets</code> to decide
what to do, e.g.:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="go"><span class="line">	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">builtinAssets</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Running with builtin assets.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="nx">cfg</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">UI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Assets</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">assetfs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">AssetFS</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">Asset</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">Asset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">AssetDir</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">AssetDir</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">AssetInfo</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">AssetInfo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Prefix</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">builtinAssets</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Assets served from %q.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">assetsPath</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="nx">cfg</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">UI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Assets</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Dir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">assetsPath</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The second important thing is that we are defining a
<a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2013/10/12/how-to-use-conditional-compilation-with-the-go-build-tool">build tag</a>
called <code>builtinassets</code>. We are also telling <code>go-bindata</code> about it, what this
means is “only compile me when builtinassets is set”, and this controls
under which circumstances <code>bindata.go</code> (which contains our assets as
Go code) is to actually be compiled.</p>

<h3 id="pre-transpilation-of-javascript">Pre-transpilation of JavaScript</h3>

<p>Last, but not the least, I want to briefly mention packing of web
assets. To describe it properly is enough material for a whole new
series of posts, and this would really have nothing to do with Go. But
I can at least list the following points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You might as well give in and install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>,
and make a <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once npm is installed, it is trivial to install the Babel command-line
compiler, <code>babel-cli</code>, which is one way to transpile JavaScript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more complicated, frustrating, but ultimately more flexible method
is to use <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a>. Webpack will
pre-transpile and do things like combine all JS into a single
file as well as minimize it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was surprised by how difficult it was to provide module import
functionality in JavaScript. The problem is that there is an ES6
standard for <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> keywords, but there is no
implementation, and even Babel assumes that something else
implements it for you. In the end I settled on
<a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs">SystemJS</a>.  The complication
with SystemJS is that now in-browser Babel transpilation needs to be
something that SystemJS is aware of, so I had to use its Babel
plugin for that. Webpack in turn (I think?) provides its own module
support implementation, so SystemJS is not needed when assets are
packed. Anyhow, it was all rather frustrating.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I would say that in the set up I describe in this four part series Go
absolutely shines, while JavaScript not so much. But once I got over
the initial hurdle of getting it all to work, React/JSX was easy and
perhaps even pleasant to work with.</p>

<p>That’s it for now, hope you find this useful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is part 3. See <a href="/blog/2017/04/27/simplistic-go-web-app/">part 1</a>
and <a href="/blog/2017/04/28/simplistic-go-web-app-part-2/">part 2</a>.</p>

<p>The previous two posts got us to a point where we had a Go app which
was able to serve a tiny bit of HTML. This post will talk about the
client side, which, alas, is mostly JavaScript, not Go.</p>

<h3 id="javascript-in-2017">JavaScript in 2017</h3>

<p>This is what gave me the most grief. I don’t really know how to
categorize the mess that present day JavaScript is, nor do I really
know what to attribute it to, and trying to rationalize it would make
for a great, but entirely different blog post. So I’m just going to
accept this as the reality we cannot change and move on to how to best
work with it.</p>

<h3 id="variants-of-js">Variants of JS</h3>

<p>The most common variant of JS these days is known as ES2015 (aka ES6 or
ECMAScript 6th Edition), and it is <em>mostly</em> supported by the more or
less latest browsers. The latest released spec of JavaScript is ES7
(aka ES2016), but since the browsers are sill catching up with ES6, it
looks like ES7 is never really going to be adopted as such, because
most likely the next coming ES8 which might be released in 2017 will
supersede it before the browsers are ready.</p>

<p>Curiously, there appears to be no simple way to construct an
environment fully specific to a particular ECMAScript version. There
is not even a way to revert to an older fully supported version ES5 or
ES4, and thus it is not really possible to test your script for
compliance. The best you can do is to test it on the browsers you have
access to and hope for the best.</p>

<p>Because of the ever changing and vastly varying support for the
language across platforms and browsers, <em>transpilation</em> has emerged as
a common idiom to address this. Transpilation mostly amounts to
JavaScript code being converted to JavaScript that complies with a
specific ES version or a particular environment. For example <code>import
Bar from 'foo';</code> might become <code>var Bar = require('foo');</code>. And so if a
particular feature is not supported, it can be made available with the
help of the right plug-in or transpiler. I suspect that the
transpilation proliferation phenomenon has led to additional problems,
such as the input expected by a transpiler assuming existence of a
feature that is no longer supported, same with output. Often this
might be remedied by additional plugins, and it can be very difficult
to sort out. On more than one occasion I spent a lot of time trying to
get something to work only to find out later that my entire approach
has been obsoleted by a new and better solution now built-in to some
other tool.</p>

<h3 id="js-frameworks">JS Frameworks</h3>

<p>There also seems to be a lot of disagreement on which JS framework is
best. It is even more confusing because the same framework can be so
radically different from one version to the next I wonder why they
didn’t just change the name.</p>

<p>I have no idea which is best, and I only had the patience to try a
couple. About a year ago I spent a bunch of time tinkering with
AngularJS, and this time, for a change, I tinkered with React. For me,
I think React makes more sense, and so this is what this example app
is using, for better or worse.</p>

<h3 id="react-and-jsx">React and JSX</h3>

<p>If you don’t know what React is, here’s my (technically incorrect)
explanation: it’s HTML embedded in JavaScript. We’re all so
brainwashed into JavaScript being embedded in HTML as the natural
order of things, that inverting this relationship does not even occur
as a possibility. For the fundamental simplicity of this revolutionary (sic)
concept I think React is quite brilliant.</p>

<p>A react “Hello World!” looks approximately like this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">who</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;World&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span><span class="line">    <span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Notice how the HTML just begins without any escape or
delimiter. Surprisingly, the opening “&lt;” works quite reliably as the
marker signifying beginning of HTML. Once inside HTML, the opening
curly brace indicates that we’re back to JavaScript temporarily, and
this is how variable values are interpolated inside HTML. That’s pretty
much all you need to know to “get” React.</p>

<p>Technically, the above file format is known as <code>JSX</code>, while React is
the library which provides the classes used to construct React objects
such as <code>React.Component</code> above. JSX is transpiled into regular
JavaScript by a tool known as Babel, and in fact JSX is not even
required, a React component can be written in plain JavaScript, and
there is a school of thought whereby React is used without JSX. I
personally find the JSX-less approach a little too noisy, and I also
like that Babel allows you to use a more modern dialect of JS (though
not having to deal with a transpiler is definitely a win).</p>

<h3 id="minimal-working-example">Minimal Working Example</h3>

<p>First, we need three pieces of external JavaScript. They are (1) React
and ReactDOM, (2) Babel in-browser transpiler and (3) a little lib
called Axios which useful for making JSON HTTP requests. I get them
out of Cloudflare CDN, there are probably other ways. To do this, we
need to augment our <code>indexHTML</code> variable to look like this:</p>

<p>At the very end it now loads <code>"/js/app.jsx"</code> which we need to
accommodate as well. Back in part 1 we created a UI config variable
called <code>cfg.Assets</code> using <code>http.Dir()</code>. We now need to wrap it in
a handler which serves files, and Go conveniently provides one:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="go"><span class="line">    <span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/js/&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">FileServer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">cfg</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Assets</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>With the above, all the files in <code>"assets/js"</code> become available under
<code>"/js/"</code>.</p>

<p>Finally we need to create the <code>assets/js/app.jsx</code> file itself:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>The only difference from the previous listing is the very last line,
which is what makes the app actually render itself.</p>

<p>If we now hit the index page from a (JS-capable) browser, we should see a “Hello
World”.</p>

<p>What happened was that the browser loaded “app.jsx” as it was
instructed, but since “jsx” is not a file type it is familiar with, it
simply ignored it. When Babel got its chance to run, it scanned our
document for any script tags referencing “text/babel” as its type, and
re-requested those pages (which makes them show up twice in developer
tools, but the second request ought to served entirely from cache). It
then transpiled it to valid JavaScript and executed it, which in turn
caused React to actually render the “Hello World”.</p>

<h3 id="listing-people">Listing People</h3>

<p>We need to first go back to the server side and create a handler that
lists people. In order for that to happen, we need an http handler,
which might look like this:</p>

<p>And we need to register it:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>Now if we hit <code>"/people"</code>, we should get a <code>"[]"</code> in response. If we
insert a record into our people table with something along the lines
of:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>The response should change to <code>[{"Id":1,"First":"John","Last":"Doe"}]</code>.</p>

<p>Finally we need to hook up our React/JSX code to make it all
render.</p>

<p>For this we are going to create a <code>PersonItem</code> component, and
another one called <code>PeopleList</code> which will use <code>PersonItem</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>PersonItem</code> only needs to know how to render itself as a table row:</p>

<p>It has a constructor which initializes a <code>this.state</code> variable. It
also declared a <code>componentDidMount()</code> method, which React will call
when the component is about to be rendered, making it the (or one of)
correct place to fetch the data from the server. It fetches the data
via an Axios call, and saves the result in
<code>this.state.people</code>. Finally, <code>render()</code> iterates over the contents of
<code>this.state.people</code> creating an instance of <code>PersonItem</code> for each.</p>

<p>That’s it, our app now responds with a (rather ugly) table listing
people from our database.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>In essence, this is all you need to know to make fully functional Web
App in Go. This app has a number of shortcomings, which I will
hopefully address later. For example in-browser transpilation is not
ideal, though it might be fine for a low volume internal app where
page load time is not important, so we might want to have a way to
pre-transpile it ahead of time. Also our JSX is confined to a single
file, this might get hard to manage for any serious size app where
there are lots of components. The app has no navigation. There is no
styling. There are probably things I’m forgetting about…</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a continuation of <a href="/blog/2017/04/27/simplistic-go-web-app/">part 1</a>.
(There is also <a href="/blog/2017/05/01/go-web-app-part-3/">part 3</a>).</p>

<p>So our app is going to have two major parts to it: client and
server. (What year is this?). The server side is going to be in Go,
and the client side in JS. Let’s talk about the server side first.</p>

<h2 id="the-go-server-side">The Go (Server) Side</h2>

<p>The server side of our application is going to be responsible for
initially serving up all the necessary JavaScript and supporting files
if any, aka static assets and data in the form of JSON. That’s it,
just two functions: (1) static assets and (2) JSON.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that serving assets is optional: assets could be
served from a CDN, for example. But what is different is that it is not
a problem for our Go app, unlike a Python/Ruby app it can perform on
par with Ngnix and Apache serving static assets. Delegating assets to
another piece of software to lighten its load is no longer necessary,
though certainly makes sense in some situations.</p>

<p>To make this simpler, let’s pretend we’re making an app that lists
people (just first and last name) from a database table, that’s
it. The code is here <a href="https://github.com/grisha/gowebapp">https://github.com/grisha/gowebapp</a>.</p>

<h3 id="directory-layout">Directory Layout</h3>

<p>It has been my experience that dividing functionality across packages
early on is a good idea in Go. Even if it is not completely clear how
the final program will be structured, it is good to keep things
separate to the extent possible.</p>

<p>For a web app I think something along the lines of the following
layout makes sense:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">9</span>
<span class="line-number">10</span>
<span class="line-number">11</span>
<span class="line-number">12</span>
<span class="line-number">13</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line"># github.com/user/foo
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line">foo/            # package main
</span><span class="line">  |
</span><span class="line">  +--daemon/    # package daemon
</span><span class="line">  |
</span><span class="line">  +--model/     # package model
</span><span class="line">  |
</span><span class="line">  +--ui/        # package ui
</span><span class="line">  |
</span><span class="line">  +--db/        # package db
</span><span class="line">  |
</span><span class="line">  +--assets/    # where we keep JS and other assets</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h3 id="top-level-package-main">Top level: <code>package main</code></h3>

<p>At the top level we have package <code>main</code> and its code in <code>main.go</code>. The
key advantage here is that with this layout <code>go get github.com/user/foo</code>
can be the only command required to install the whole application into
<code>$GOPATH/bin</code>.</p>

<p>Package <code>main</code> should do as little as possible. The only code that
belongs here is to parse the command argument flags. If the app had a
config file, I’d stick parsing and checking of that file into yet
another package, probably called <code>config</code>. After that main should pass
the control to the <code>daemon</code> package.</p>

<p>An essential main.go is:</p>

<p>The above program accepts three parameters, <code>-listen</code>, <code>-db-connect</code>
and <code>-assets-path</code>, nothing earth shattering.</p>

<h4 id="using-structs-for-clarity">Using structs for clarity</h4>

<p>In line <code>cfg := &amp;daemon.Config{}</code> we are creating a <code>daemon.Config</code>
object. It’s main purpose is to pass around configuration in a
structured and clear format. Every one of our packages defines its own
<code>Config</code> type describing the parameters it needs, and packages can
include other package configs. We see an example of this in
<code>processFlags()</code> above: <code>flag.StringVar(&amp;cfg.Db.ConnectString,
...</code>. Here <code>db.Config</code> is included in <code>daemon.Config</code>. I find doing
this very useful. These structures also keep open the possibility of
serializing configs as JSON, TOML or whatever.</p>

<h4 id="using-httpfilesystem-to-serve-assets">Using http.FileSystem to serve assets</h4>

<p>The <code>http.Dir(assetsPath)</code> in <code>setupHttpAssets</code> is in preparation to
how we will serve the assets in the <code>ui</code> package. The reason it’s done
this way is to leave the door open for <code>cfg.UI.Assets</code> (which is a
<code>http.FileSystem</code> interface) to be provided by other implementations,
e.g. serving this content from memory.  I will describe it in more
detail in a later post.</p>

<p>Lastly, main calls <code>daemon.Run(cfg)</code> which is what actually starts our
app and where it blocks until it’s terminated.</p>

<h3 id="package-daemon"><code>package daemon</code></h3>

<p>Package <code>daemon</code> contains everything related to running a
process. Stuff like which port to listen on, custom logging would
belong here, as well anything related to a graceful restart, etc.</p>

<p>Since the job of the <code>daemon</code> package is to initiate the database
connection, it will need to import the <code>db</code> package. It’s also
responsible for listening on the TCP port and starting the user
interface for that listener, therefore it needs to import the <code>ui</code>
package, and since the <code>ui</code> package needs to access data, which is
done via the <code>model</code> package, it will need to import <code>model</code> as well.</p>

<p>A bare bones <code>daemon</code> might look like this:</p>

<p>Note how <code>Config</code> includes <code>db.Config</code> and <code>ui.Config</code> as I described
earlier.</p>

<p>All the action happens in <code>Run(*Config)</code>. We initialize a database
connection, create a <code>model.Model</code> instance, and start the <code>ui</code>
passing in the config, a pointer to the model and the listener.</p>

<h3 id="package-model"><code>package model</code></h3>

<p>The purpose of <code>model</code> is to separate how data is stored in the
database from the <code>ui</code>, as well as to contain any business logic an
app might have. It’s the brains of the app if you will.</p>

<p>The <code>model</code> package should define a struct (<code>Model</code> seems like an
appropriate name) and a pointer to an instance of the struct should be
passed to all the <code>ui</code> functions and methods. There should only be one
such instance in our app - for extra credit you can enforce that
programmatically by making it a singleton, but I don’t think that’s
necessary.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could get by without a <code>Model</code> and just use the
package <code>model</code> itself. I don’t like this approach, but it’s an
option.</p>

<p>The model should also define structs for the data entities we are
dealing with. In our example it would be a <code>Person</code> struct. Its
members should be exported (capitalized) because other packages will
be accessing those. If you use
<a href="https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx">sqlx</a>, this is where you would also
specify tags that map elements to db column names, e.g. <code>`db:"first_name"`</code></p>

<p>Our Person type:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="go"><span class="line"><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="nx">Person</span> <span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="nx">Id</span>          <span class="kt">int64</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="nx">First</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Last</span> <span class="kt">string</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>In our case we do not need tags because our column names match the
element names, and sqlx conveniently takes care of the capitalization,
so <code>Last</code> matches the column named <code>last</code>.</p>

<h4 id="package-model-should-not-import-db">package model should NOT import db</h4>

<p>Somewhat counter-intuitive, <code>model</code> cannot import <code>db</code>. This is
because <code>db</code> needs to import <code>model</code>, and circular imports are not
allowed in Go. This is one case where interfaces come in
handy. <code>model</code> needs to define an interface which <code>db</code> should
satisfy. For now all we know is we need to list people, so we can
start with this definition:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="go"><span class="line"><span class="kd">type</span> <span class="nx">db</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="nx">SelectPeople</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">([]</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">error</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Our app doesn’t really do much, but we know it lists people, so our
model should probably have a <code>People() ([]*Person, error)</code> method:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="go"><span class="line"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Model</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nx">People</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">([]</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">error</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>To keep things tidy, code should be in separate files, e.g. <code>Person</code>
definition should be in <code>person.go</code>, etc. For readability, here is a
single file version of our <code>model</code>:</p>

<h3 id="package-db"><code>package db</code></h3>

<p><code>db</code> is the actual implementation of the database interaction. This is
where the SQL statements are constructed and executed. This package
also imports <code>model</code> because it will need to construct those structs
from database data.</p>

<p>First, <code>db</code> needs to provide the <code>InitDb</code> function which will
establish the database connection, as well as create the necessary
tables and prepare the SQL statements.</p>

<p>Our simplistic example doesn’t support migrations, but in theory this
is also where they might potentially happen.</p>

<p>We are using PostgreSQL, which means we need to import the
<a href="https://github.com/lib/pq">pq</a> driver. We are also going to rely on
sqlx, and we need our own <code>model</code>. Here is the beginning of our <code>db</code>
implementation:</p>

<p>Finally, we need to provide the method to satisfy the interface:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Here we’re taking advantage of sqlx to run the query and construct a
slice from results with a simple call to <code>Select()</code> (NB:
<code>p.sqlSelectPeople</code> is a <code>*sqlx.Stmt</code>). Without sqlx we would have to
iterate over the result rows, processing each with <code>Scan</code>, which would
be considerably more verbose.</p>

<p>Beware of a very subtle “gotcha” here. <code>people</code> could also be defined
as <code>var people []*model.Person</code> and the method would work just the
same. However, if the database returned no rows, the method would
return <code>nil</code>, not an empty slice. If the result of this method is
later encoded as JSON, the former would become <code>null</code> and the latter
<code>[]</code>. This could cause problems if the client side doesn’t know how to
treat <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>That’s it for <code>db</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to serve all that stuff via HTTP and that’s what the
<code>ui</code> package does.</p>

<p>Note how <code>indexHTML</code> contains next to nothing. This is 100% of the
HTML that this app will ever serve. It will evolve a little as we get
into the client side of the app, but only by a few lines.</p>

<p>Also noteworthy is how the handler is defined. If this idiom is not
familiar, it’s worth spending a few minutes (or a day) to internalize
it completely as it is very common in Go. <code>indexHandler()</code> is not a
handler, it <em>returns</em> a handler function. It is done this way so
that we can pass in a <code>*model.Model</code> via closure, since an HTTP
handler function definition is fixed and a model pointer is not one of
the parameters.</p>

<p>In the case of <code>indexHandler()</code> we’re not actually doing anything with
the model pointer, but when we get to implementing an actual list of
people we will need it.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Above is essentially all the knowledge required to build a basic Go
web app, at least the Go side of it. Next week I’ll get into the
client side and we will complete the people listing code.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I started building yet another web-based app, in Go.
I’ve decided to use this opportunity to start from scratch and build
it to the best of my understanding of how an app ought to be built in
2017. I’ve spent many hours getting to the bottom of all things I’ve
typically avoided in the past, just so that for once in many years I
can claim to have a personal take on the matter.</p>

<p>This post is the beginning of what I expect to be a short series
highlighting what I’ve learned in the process. The first part is a
general introduction describing the present problematic state of
affairs, it contains no code or examples. I expect to be moving into
details in future posts. I am curious whether my experience resonates
with others, and what I may have gotten wrong, so don’t hesitate to
comment!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the past my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript has been
sufficient for my modest site building needs. Most of the apps I’ve
ever built were done using mod_python directly using the publisher
handler. Ironically for an early Python adopter, I’ve also done a fair
bit of work with Rails. For the past several years I focused on (big)
data infrastructure, which isn’t web development at all, though having
a web-based UI’s is quite common. In fact the app I’m referring to
here is a data app, but it’s not open source and what it does really
doesn’t matter for this discussion. Anyway, this should provide some
perspective of where I come from when approaching this problem.</p>

<h3 id="python-and-ruby">Python and Ruby</h3>

<p>As recently as a year ago, Python and Ruby would be what I would
recommend for a web app environment. There may be other similar
languages, but from where I stand, the world is dominated by Python and
Ruby.</p>

<p>For the longest time the main job of a web application was constructing
web pages by piecing HTML together server-side. Both Python and Ruby
are very well suited for the template-driven work of taking data from
a database and turning it into a bunch of HTML. There are lots of
frameworks/tools to choose from, e.g. Rails, Django, Sinatra, Flask,
etc, etc.</p>

<p>And even though these languages have certain significant limitations,
such as the GIL, the ease with which they address the complexity of
generating HTML is far more valuable than any trade-offs that came
with them.</p>

<h3 id="the-gil">The GIL</h3>

<p>The Global Interpreter Lock is worthy of a separate mention. It is the
elephant in the room, by far the biggest limitation of any Python or
Ruby solution. It is so crippling, people can get emotional talking
about it, there are endless GIL discussions in both Ruby and Python
communities.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with the problem - the GIL only lets one thing
happen at a time. When you create threads and it “looks” like parallel
execution, the interpreter is still executing instructions
sequentially. This means that a single process can only take advantage
of a single CPU.</p>

<p>There do exist alternative implementations, for example JVM-based, but
they are not the norm. I’m not exactly clear why, they may not be
fully interchangeable, they probably do not support C extensions
correctly, and they might still have a GIL, not sure, but as far as I
can tell, the C implementation is what everyone uses out
there. Re-implementing the interpreter without the GIL would amount to
a complete rewrite, and more importantly it may affect the behavior of
the language (at least that’s my naive understanding), and so for this
reason I think the GIL is here to stay.</p>

<p>Web apps of any significant scale absolutely require the ability to
serve requests in parallel, taking advantage of every CPU a machine
has. Thus far the only possible solution known is to run multiple
instances of the app as separate processes.</p>

<p>This is typically done with help of additional software such as
Unicorn/Gunicorn with every process listening on its own port and
running behind some kind of a connection balancer such as Nginx and/or
Haproxy. Alternatively it can be accomplished via Apache and its
modules (such as mod_python or mod_wsgi), either way it’s
complicated. Such apps typically rely on the database server as the
arbiter for any concurrency-sensitive tasks. To implement caching
without keeping many copies of the same thing on the same server a
separate memory-based store is required, e.g. Memcached or Redis,
usually both. These apps also cannot do any background processing, for
that there is a set of tools such as Resque. And then all these
components need to be monitored to make sure it’s working. Logs need
to be consolidated and there are additional tools for that. Given the
inevitable complexity of this set up there is also a requirement for a
configuration manager such as Chef or Puppet. And still, these set ups
are generally not capable of maintaining a large number of long term
connections, a problem known as C10K.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that a simple database-backed web app requires a whole
bunch of moving parts before it can serve a “Hello World!” page. And
nearly all of it because of the GIL.</p>

<h3 id="emergence-of-single-page-applications">Emergence of Single Page Applications</h3>

<p>More and more, server-side HTML generation is becoming a thing of the
past. The latest (and correct) trend is for UI construction and
rendering to happen completely client-side, driven by JavaScript. Apps
whose user interface is fully JS-driven are sometimes called Single
Page Applications, and are in my opinion the future. In an SPA
scenario the server only serves data, typically as JSON, and no HTML
is constructed there. In this set up, the tremendous complexity
introduced primarily so that a popular scripting language could be
used isn’t worth the trouble. Especially considering that Python or
Ruby bring little to the table when all of the output is JSON.</p>

<h3 id="enter-golang">Enter Golang</h3>

<p>Go is gradually disrupting the the world of web applications. Go
natively supports parallel execution which eliminates the requirement
for nearly all the components typically used to work around the GIL
limitation.</p>

<p>Go programs are binaries which run natively, so there is no need for
anything language-specific to be installed on the server. Gone is the
problem of ensuring the correct runtime version the app requires,
there is no separate runtime, it’s part of the binary.  Go programs
can easily and elegantly run tasks in the background, thus no need for
tools like Resque. Go programs run as a single process which makes
caching trivial and means Memcached or Redis is not necessary either.
Go can handle an unlimited number of parallel connections, eliminating
the need for a front-end guard like Nginx.</p>

<p>With Go the tall stack of Python, Ruby, Bundler, Virtualenv, Unicorn,
WSGI, Resque, Memcached, Redis, etc, etc is reduced to just one
binary. The only other component generally still needed is a database
(I recommend PostgreSQL). It’s important to note that all of these
tools are available as before for optional use, but with Go there is
the option of getting by entirely without them.</p>

<p>To boot this Go program will most likely outperform any Python/Ruby
app by an order of magnitude, require less memory, and with fewer
lines of code.</p>

<h3 id="so-is-there-a-popular-framework-yet">So Is there a Popular Framework Yet?</h3>

<p>The short answer is: a framework is entirely optional and not
recommended. There are many projects claiming to be great frameworks,
but I think it’s best to try to get by without one.  This isn’t just
my personal opinion, I find that it is generally shared in the Go
community.</p>

<p>It helps to think why frameworks existed in the first place. On the
Python/Ruby side this was because these languages were not initially
designed to serve web pages, and lots of external components were
necessary to bring them up to the task. Same can be said for Java,
which just like Python and Ruby, is about as old as the web as we know
it, or even pre-dates it slightly.</p>

<p>As I remember it, out of the box, early versions of Python did not
provide anything to communicate with a database, there was no
templating, HTTP support was confusing, networking was non-trivial,
bundling crypto would not even be legal then, and there was a whole
lot of other things missing. A framework provided all the necessary
pieces and set out rules for idiomatic development for all the common
web app use cases.</p>

<p>Go, on the other hand, was built by people who already experienced and
understood web development. It includes just about everything
necessary. An external package or two can be needed to deal with certain
specific aspects, e.g. OAuth, but by no means does a couple of
packages constitute a “framework”.</p>

<p>If the above take on frameworks not convincing enough, it’s helpful to
consider the framework learning curve and the risks. It took me about
two years to get comfortable with Rails. Frameworks can become
abandoned and obsolete, porting apps to a new framework is hard if
not impossible. Given how quickly the information technology sands
shift, frameworks are not to be chosen lightly.</p>

<p>I’d like to specifically single out tools and frameworks that attempt
to mimic idioms common to the Python, Ruby or the JavaScript
environments. Anything that looks or feels or claims to be “Rails for
Go”, features techniques like injection, dynamic method publishing
and the like which require relying heavily on reflection are not the
Go way of doing things, it’s best to stay away from those.</p>

<p>Frameworks definitely do make some things easier, especially in the
typical business CRUD world, where apps have many screens with lots of
fields, manipulating data in complex and ever-changing database
schemas. In such an environment, I’m not sure Go is a good choice in
the first place, especially if performance and scaling are not a
priority.</p>

<p>Another issue common to frameworks is that they abstract lower level
mechanisms from the developer often in way that over time grows to be
so arcane that it is literally impossible to figure out what is
actually happening. What begins with an idiomatic alias for a single
line of JavaScript becomes layers upon layers of transpilers,
minimizers on top of helpers hidden somewhere in a sub-dependency. One
day something breaks and it’s impossible to know where to even look
for the problem. It’s nice to know exactly what is going on sometimes,
Go is generally very good about that.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-the-database-and-orm">What about the database and ORM?</h3>

<p>Similarly to frameworks, Go culture is not big on ORM’s. For starters,
Go specifically does not support objects, which is what the O in ORM
stands for.</p>

<p>I know that writing SQL by hand instead of relying on
<code>User.find(:all).filter...</code> convenience provided to by the likes of
ActiveRecord is unheard of in some communities, but I think this
attitude needs to change. SQL is an amazing language. Dealing with SQL
directly is not that hard, and quite liberating, as well as incredibly
powerful. Possibly the most tedious part of it all is copying the data
from a database cursor into structures, but here I found the sqlx
project very useful.</p>

<h3 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think this sufficiently describes the present situation of the
server side. The client side I think could be separate post, so I’ll
pause here for now. To sum up, thus far it looks like we’re building
an app with roughly the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimal reliance on third party packages.</li>
  <li>No web framework.</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL backend.</li>
  <li>Single Page Application.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On a completely different subject, I find it remarkable how easily,
we, as a society, can throw around assertions of existence or
inexistence. As purveyors of goods entirely of conceptual nature us
programmers ought to be particularly attuned to the subtleties
involved.</p>

<p>Think of a recently demolished building. Does it still exist? As a
building, not really, yet all of its atoms are still around (possibly
as energy). Both before and after demolition all that the building was
made of existed physically, but what we refer to as a “building” is a
particular physical configuration, which was no longer due to the
demolition.</p>

<p>Does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sawyer">Tom Sawyer</a> exist?
Wikipedia obviously thinks so, and most readers would recognize the
name as that of a widely known fictional character. As a <em>concept</em>,
Tom Sawer undeniably exists. Yet no particle has ever comprised
him. In other words <em>physically</em> he does not exist. And if all the
beings capable of conceptualizing Tom ceased to exist, would he follow
their fate, or would he still be?</p>

<p>Okay, Tom Sawyer being imaginary is one thing, but how about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a>?  Does math
exist?  Could we state that math does not exist? That would sound
crazy, though we could state that <em>physically</em> math does not
exist. Unlike Tom Sawyer, however, we can’t claim mathematics to have
been imagined by us. The ratio of a circle’s circumference to its
diameter had existed as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">constant</a>
before any intelligent life and will continue to exist long after
we’re gone. Yet the statement that Pi <em>physically</em> does not exist
somehow sounds slightly odd to my ear, after all Pi is fundamental to
the laws of nature to which all things physical conform. One key
subtelty here is whether existence implies recognition: before we
understood algebra or geometry they didn’t exist, but now, after
millenia of scientific exploration and discovery they do? Or have they
always existed, irrespective of anyone’s understanding?</p>

<p>And finally, what about the being whose existence is most contested:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a>. Does God exist? As a concept
God quite certainly exists. Regardless of whether you belive that God
exists, you do recognize the concept. Physically though,
it is not likely that God exists, after all, if you had god-like
abilities and created your own universe including the mere concept of
existence, it probably wouldn’t apply to you and you wouldn’t actually
be in it? And so if physically God does not exist, is God in the same
category as Pi? Has God never existed, always existed, only existed
when recognized, existed irrespective of our understanding or neither
of the above?</p>

<p>Think carefully next time you use the word “is”…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After nearly two years of hacking, I am tagging this version of
<a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres">Tgres</a>
as beta. It is functional and stable enough for people to try out and
not feel like they are wasting their time. There is still a lot that
could and should be improved, but at this point the most
important thing is to get more people to check it out.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-tgres">What is Tgres?</h3>

<p>Tgres is a <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> program which can receive time
series data via <a href="https://graphiteapp.org/">Graphite</a>, <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/wiki">Statsd</a>
protocols or an http <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/http#PixelHandler">pixel</a>, store it
in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, and provide Graphite-like access to the data
in a way that is compatible with tools such as <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. You could think of it as a
drop-in Graphite/Statsd replacement, though I’d rather avoid direct
comparison, because the key feature of Tgres is that data is stored in
PostgreSQL.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/02/28/tgres-load-testing-follow-up/"><img src="/images/tgres_load_head_01.png" /></a></p>

<h3 id="why-postgresql">Why PostgreSQL?</h3>

<p>The “grand vision” for Tgres begins with the database. Relational
databases have the most man-decades of any storage type invested into
them, and PostgreSQL is probably the most advanced implementation
presently in existence.</p>

<p>If you search for “relational databases and time series” (or
some variation thereupon), you will come across the whole gamut of
opinions (if not convictions) varying so widely it is but
discouraging. This is because time series storage, while simple at
first glance, is actually fraught with subtleties and ambiguities that
can drive even the most patient of us up the wall.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-solving-the-storage-problem">Avoid Solving the Storage Problem.</h3>

<p>Someone once said that “anything is possible when you don’t know what
you’re talking about”, and nowhere is it more evident than in data
storage. File systems and relational databases trace their origin back
to the late 1960s and over half a century later I doubt that
any field experts would say “the storage problem is solved”. And so it seems
almost foolish to suppose that by throwing together a key-value store and a
concensus algorithm or some such it is possible to come up with
something <em>better</em>? Instead of re-inventing storage, why not focus on
how to structure the data in a way that is compatible with a
storage implementation that we know works and scales reliably?</p>

<p>As part of the Tgres project, I thought it’d be interesting to get to
the bottom of this. If not bottom, then at least deeper than most
people dare to dive. I am not a mathematician or a statistician, nor
am I a data scientist, whatever that means, but I think I understand
enough about the various subjects involved, including programming,
that I can come up with something more than just another off-the-cuff
opinion.</p>

<p>And so now I think I can conclude definitively that time
series data can be stored in a relational database very efficently, PostgreSQL in
particular for its support for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/arrays.html">arrays</a>.
The general approach I described in a series of blogs starting with
<a href="/blog/2015/09/23/storing-time-series-in-postgresql-efficiently/">this one</a>,
Tgres uses the technique described in the
<a href="/blog/2017/01/21/storing-time-seris-in-postgresql-optimize-for-write/">last one</a>.
In my <a href="/blog/2017/02/28/tgres-load-testing-follow-up/">performance tests</a>
the Tgres/Postgres combination was so efficient it was possibly
outperforming its time-series <a href="http://obfuscurity.com/2016/09/Benchmarking-Graphite-master-on-AWS">siblings</a>.</p>

<p>The good news is that as a user you don’t need to think about the
complexities of the data layout, Tgres takes care of it. Still I very
much wish people would take more time to think about how to organize
data in a tried and true solution like PostgreSQL before jumping ship
into the murky waters of the “noSQL” ocean, lured by alternative
storage sirens, big on promise but shy on delivery, only to drown
where no one could come to the rescue.</p>

<h3 id="how-else-is-tgres-different">How else is Tgres different?</h3>

<p>Tgres is a single program, a single binary which does everything
(one of my favorite things about Go). It supports all of Graphite
and Statsd protocols without having to run separate
processes, there are no dependencies of any kind other than a PostgreSQL
database. No need for Python, Node or a JVM, just the binary, the
<a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/blob/v0.10.0b/etc/tgres.conf.sample">config file</a>
and access to a database.</p>

<p>And since the data is stored in Postgres, virtually all of the
features of Postgres are available: from being able to query
the data using real SQL with all the latest features, to replication,
security, performance, back-ups and whatever else Postgres
offers.</p>

<p>Another benefit of data being in a database is that it can be
accessible to any application frameworks in Python, Ruby or whatever
other language as just another database table. For example in Rails it
might be as trivial as <code>class Tv &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end</code> et voilà,
you have the data points as a model.</p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that Tgres requires no PostgreSQL
extensions. This is because optimizing by implementing a custom
extension which circumvents the PostgreSQL natural way of handling
data means we are solving the storage problem again. PostgreSQL
storage is not broken to begin with, no customization is necessary to
handle time series.</p>

<p>In addition to being a standalone program, Tgres packages aim to be useful on their own
as part of any other Go program. For example it is very easy to equip a Go application with Graphite
capabilities by providing it access to a database and using the
provided http
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/http#GraphiteRenderHandler">handler</a>. This
also means that you can use a separate Tgres instance dedicated to querying data
(perhaps from a downstream Potgres slave).</p>

<h3 id="some-internals-overview">Some Internals Overview</h3>

<p>Internally, Tgres series identification is tag-based. The series are
identified by a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-json.html">JSONB</a>
field which is a set of key/value pairs indexed using a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/gin-intro.html">GIN index</a>.
In Go, the JSONB field becomes a
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/serde#Ident">serde.Ident</a>.
Since the “outside” interface Tgres is presently mimicking is Graphite,
which uses dot-separated series identifiers, all idents are made of just one tag
“name”, but this will change as we expand the DSL.</p>

<p>Tgres stores data in evenly-spaced series. The conversion from the
data as it comes in to its evenly-spaced form happens on-the-fly,
using a <a href="/blog/2016/08/04/data-points/">weighted mean</a> method, and
the resulting stored rate is actually correct. This is similar to how
<a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> does it, but different from
many other tools which simply discard all points except for last in the same
series slot as I explained in <a href="/blog/2015/05/04/recording-time-series/">this post</a>.</p>

<p>Tgres maintains a (configurable) number of Round-Robin Archives (RRAs)
of varying length and resolution for each series, this is an approach
similar to RRDTool and Graphite Whisper as well. The conversion to
evenly-spaced series happens in the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/rrd">rrd</a> package.</p>

<p>Tgres does not store the original (unevenly spaced) data points. The
rationale behind this is that for analytical value you always
inevitably have to convert an uneven series to a regular one. The
problem of storing the original data points is not a time-seires
problem, the main challenge there is the ability to keep up with a
massive influx of data, and this is what Hadoop, Cassandra, S3,
BigQuery, etc are excellent at.</p>

<p>While Tgres code implements most of the <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html">Graphite functions</a>,
complete compatibility with the Graphite DSL is not a goal, and some
functions will probably left uniplemented. In my opinion the Graphite
DSL has a number of shortcomings by design. For example, the series names are not
strings but are syntactically identifiers, i.e. there is no
difference between <code>scale(foo.bar, 10)</code> and <code>scale("foo.bar", 10)</code>,
which is problematic in more than one way. The dot-names are
ingrained into the DSL, and lots of functions take arguments denoting
position within the dot-names, but they seem unnecessary. For
example there is <code>averageSeriesWithWildcards</code> and
<code>sumSeriesWithWildcards</code>, while it would be cleaner to have some kind
of a <code>wildcard()</code> function which can be passed into <code>average()</code> or
<code>sum()</code>. Another example is that Graphite does not support chaining (but Tgres already
does), e.g. <code>scale(average("foo.*"), 10)</code> might be better as
<code>average("foo.*").scale(10)</code>. There are many more similar small
grievances I have with the DSL, and in the end I think that the DSL ought to be
revamped to be more like a real language (or perhaps just be a
language, e.g. Go itself), exactly how hasn’t been crystalized just
yet.</p>

<p>Tgres also aims to be a useful time-series processing Golang package
(or a set of packages). This means that in Go the code also needs to
be clean and readable, and that there ought to be a conceptual
correspondence between the DSL and how one might to something at the
lower level in Go. Again, the vision here is still blurry, and more
thinking is required.</p>

<p>For Statsd functionality, the network protocol is supported by the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/statsd">tgres/statsd</a>
package while the aggregation is done by the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/aggregator">tgres/aggregator</a>. In
addition, there is also support for “paced metrics” which let you
aggregate data <em>before</em> it is passed on to the Tgres receiver and
becomes a data point, which is useful in situations where you have
some kind of an iteration that would otherwise generate millions of
measurements per second.</p>

<p>The finest resolution for Tgres is a millisecond. Nanoseconds seems
too small to be practical, though it shouldn’t be too hard to change
it, as internally Tgres uses native Go types for time and duration -
the milliseconds are the integers in the database.</p>

<p>When the Data points are received via the network, the job of parsing the
network stuff is done by the code in the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/daemon">tgres/daemon</a>
package with some help from <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/http">tgres/http</a>
and <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/statsd">tgres/statsd</a>, as well as
potentially others (e.g. Python pickle decoding).</p>

<p>Once received and correctly parsed, they are passed on to the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/receiver">tgres/receiver</a>. The
receiver’s job is to check whether this series ident is known to us
by checking the cache or that it needs to be loaded from the
database or created. Once the appropriate series is found, the
receiver updates the in-memory cache of the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/rrd#RoundRobinArchive">RRAs</a>
for the series (which causes the data points to be evenly spaced) as well as
periodically flushes data points to the data base. The
receiver also controls the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/aggregator">aggregator</a>
of statsd metrics.</p>

<p>The database interface code is in the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/serde">tgres/serde</a>
package which supports PostgreSQL or an in-memory database (useful
in situations where persistence is not required or during testing).</p>

<p>When Tgres is queried for data, it loads it from the database
into a variety of implementations of the Series interface in the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/series">tgres/series</a> package
as controlled by the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/dsl">tgres/dsl</a>
responsible for figuring out what is asked of it in the query.</p>

<p>In addition to all of the above, Tgres supports clustering, though this is
highly experimental at this point. The idea
is that a cluster of Tgres instances (all backed by the same database,
at least for now) would split the series amongst themselves and
forward data points to the node which is responsible for a particular
series. The nodes are placed behind a load-balancer of some kind, and
with this set up nodes can go in and out of the cluster without any
overall downtime for maximum availability. The clustering logic lives in
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/cluster">tgres/cluster</a>.</p>

<p>This is an overly simplistic overview which hopefully conveys that
there are a lot of pieces to Tgres.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>In addition to a new/better DSL, there are lots of interesting ideas,
and if you have any please chime in on Github.</p>

<p>One thing that is missing in the telemetry world is encryption,
authentication and access control so that tools like Tgres could be
used to store health data securely.</p>

<p>A useful feature might be interoperability with big data tools to
store the original data points and perhaps provide means for pulling
them out of BigQuery or whatever and replay them into series - this
way we could change the resolution to anything at will.</p>

<p>Or little details like a series alias - so that a series could be
renamed. The way this would work is you rename a series while keeping
its old ident as an alias, then take your time to make sure all the
agents send data under the new name, at which point the alias can go
away.</p>

<p>Lots can also be done on the scalability front with improved
clustering, sharding, etc.</p>

<h2 id="we-could-use-your-help">We Could Use Your Help</h2>

<p>Last but not least, this is an Open Source project. It works best when
people who share the vision also contribute to the project, and this
is where you come in. If you’re interested in learning more about time
series and databases, please check it out and feel free to contribute
in any way you can!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To follow up on the <a href="/blog/2017/02/23/can-tgres-outperform-graphite/">previous post</a>,
after a bunch
of tweaking, here is Tgres (<a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/commit/90924e4afa4ac8bef61caf46c3439794983660ec">commit</a>) receiving over 150,000 data points per
second across 500,000 time series without any signs of the queue size
or any other resource blowing up.</p>

<p>This is both Tgres and Postgres running on the same i2.2xlarge EC2 instance (8 cores, 64GB, SSD).</p>

<p><img src="/images/tgres_aws1_150k.png" /></p>

<p>At this point I think there’s been enough load testing and optimization, and I am
going to get back to crossing the t’s and dotting the i’s so that we can release
the first version of Tgres.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Note: there is an <a href="/blog/2017/02/28/tgres-load-testing-follow-up/">update</a> to this post.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>On a 8 CPU / 16 GB EC2 instance,
<a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres">Tgres</a> can process 150,000 data
points per second across 300,000 series (Postgres running on the same
machine). With some tweaks we were able to get the number of series to
half a million, flushing ~60K data points per second.</p>

<h2 id="now-the-long-version">Now the long version…</h2>

<p>If you were to ask me whether Tgres could outperform Graphite, just a
couple of months ago my answer would have been “No”. Tgres uses
Postgres to store time series data, while Graphite stores data by
writing to files directly, the overhead of the relational database
just seemed too great.</p>

<p>Well, I think I’ve managed to prove myself wrong. After re-working
Tgres to use the
<a href="/blog/2017/01/21/storing-time-seris-in-postgresql-optimize-for-write/">write-optimized layout</a>,
I’ve run some tests on AWS yielding unexpectedly promising results.</p>

<p>As a benchmark I targeted the excellent <a href="http://obfuscurity.com/2016/08/Benchmarking-Carbon-and-Whisper-on-AWS">blog post</a>
by Jason Dixon describing his AWS Graphite test. My goal was to get to at least half the
level of performance described therein. But it appears the combination of Go, Postgres and some
clever data structuring has been able to beat it, not without breaking
a little sweat, but it has.</p>

<p>My test was conducted on a
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">c4.2xlarge</a> instance,
which has 8 cores and 16 GB, using 100GB EBS (which, if I understood it
correctly, comes with 300 IOPS, please comment if I’m wrong). The “c4”
instances are supposed to be some of the highest speed CPU AWS has to
offer, but compare this with the instance used in the Graphite test,
an i2.4xlarge (16 CPU/ 122GB), it had half the CPU cores and nearly
one tenth of the RAM.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, here is the obligatory screenshot, then my
observations and lessons learned in the process, as well as a
screenshot depicting even better performance.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tgres_aws1.png" /></p>

<p>The Tgres version running was <a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/1c57cba3fe4cdb0b96bf5054cfd01cb2a41e2bba">this one</a>,
with the config detailed at the bottom of the post.</p>

<p>Postgres was whatever <code>yum install postgresql95-server</code> brings your
way, with the <code>data</code> directory moved to the EBS volume formatted using
ext4 (not that I think it matters). The Postgres config was modified to
allow a 100ms commit delay and to make autovacuum extra aggressive. I
did not increase any memory buffers and left everything else as
is. Specifically, these were the changes:</p>

<p>The data points for the test were generated by a [goroutine](https://github.com/tgres/tgres/blob/06a9f5805a934c304b11f44a32792414ceafe6f0/blaster/blaster.go#L55
in the Tgres process itself. In the past I’ve found that blasting a server
with this many UDP packets can be tricky and hardware/network
intensive. It’s also hard to tell when/if they get dropped and why,
etc. Since Go is not known for having problems in its network stack, I
was not too worried about it, I just wanted a reliable and
configurable source of incoming packets, and in Go world writing a
simple goroutine seemed like the right answer.</p>

<h2 id="somewhat-random-notes-and-making-tgres-even-faster">Somewhat Random Notes and Making Tgres Even Faster</h2>

<h3 id="determining-failure">Determining failure</h3>

<p>Determining when we are “at capacity” is tricky. I’ve mostly looked at
two factors (aside from the obvious - running out of memory/disk,
becoming unresponsive, etc): receiver queue size
and Postgres <a href="https://www.keithf4.com/checking-for-postgresql-bloat/">table bloat</a>.</p>

<h4 id="queue-size">Queue size</h4>

<p>Tgres uses “elastic channels” (so eloquently

for incoming data points and to load series from Postgres.  These are
channel-like structures that can grow to arbitrary length only limited
by the memory available. This is done so as to be able to take maximum
advantage of the hardware at hand. If any of those queues starts
growing out of control, we are failing. You can see in the picture
that at about 140K data points per second the receiver queue started
growing, though it did stay steady at this size and never spun out of
control (the actual test was left overnight at this rate just to make
sure).</p>

<h4 id="pg-table-bloat">PG Table Bloat</h4>

<p>Table bloat is a phenomenon affecting Postgres in write-intensive
situations because of its adherence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">MVCC</a>.
It basically means that pages on disk are being updated faster than the autovacuum
process can keep up with them and the table starts growing out of
control.</p>

<p>To monitor for table bloat, I used a simple formula which determined
the approximate size of the table based on the row count (our data is
all floats, which makes it very predictable) and compared it with the
actual size. If the actual size exceeded the estimated size, that’s
considered bloat. Bloat is reported in the “TS Table Size” chart. A
little bloat is fine, and you can see that it stayed in fairly low
percent throughout the test.</p>

<p>In the end, though more research is warranted, it may just turn out
that contrary to every expectation PostgreSQL was <em>not</em> the limiting
factor here. The <code>postmaster</code> processes stayed below 170MB RSS, which
is absolutely remarkable, and Grafana refreshes were very quick even
at peak loads.</p>

<h4 id="memory-consumption">Memory consumption</h4>

<p>Tgres has a slight limitation in that creating a series is
expensive. It needs to check with Postgres and for reasons I don’t
want to bore you with it’s always a SELECT, optionally followed by an
“UPSERT”. This takes time, and during the ramp-up period when the
number of series is growing fast and lots of them need to be created,
the Go runtime ends up consuming a lot of memory. You can see that
screenshot image reports 4.69GB. If I were to restart Tgres (which
would cause all existing DS names to be pre-cached) its memory
footprint stayed at about 1.7GB. More work needs to be done to figure
out what accounts for the difference.</p>

<h4 id="data-point-rate-and-number-of-series">Data Point Rate and Number of Series</h4>

<p>The rate of data points that need to be saved to disk is a function of
the number of series and the resolution of the RRAs. To illustrate, if
I have one series at 1 point per second, even if I blast a million
data points per second, still only 1 data point per second needs to be
saved.</p>

<p>There is an important difference between Graphite and Tgres in that
Tgres actually adjusts the final value considering the every data
point value using weighted mean, while Graphite just ignores all
points but the last. So Tgres does a bit more work, which adds up
quickly at 6-figure rates per second.</p>

<p>The Graphite test if I read the chart correctly was able to process
~70K data points per second across 300K series. My test had 300K
series and data points were coming in at over 150K/s. But just out of
curiosity, I tried to push it to its limit.</p>

<p>At 400 series, you can see clear signs of deterioration. You can see
how vcache isn’t flushed fast enough leaving gaps at the end of
series. If we stop the data blast, it does eventually catch up,
so long as there is memory for the cache.</p>

<p>If you don’t catch this condition in time, Tgres will die with:</p>

<h3 id="segment-width">Segment Width</h3>

<p>There is still one easy performance card we can play here. Segment
width is how many data points are stored in one row, it is also the
limit on how many points we can transfer in a single SQL operation.
Segment width by default is 200, because a width higher than that
causes rows to exceed a page and trigger
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/storage-toast.html">TOAST</a>.
TOAST can be good or bad because it means data is stored in a separate table
(not so good), but it also means it’s compressed, which may be an I/O
win.</p>

<h4 id="so-what-would-happen-if-we-set-the-segment-width-to-1000">So what would happen if we set the segment width to 1000?</h4>

<p>The picture changes significantly (see below). I was able to get the
number of series to 500K, note the whopping 52,602 data points being
written to the database per second! You can see we’re pushing it to
the limit because the receiver queue is beginning to grow. I <em>really</em>
wanted to get the rate up to 150K/sec, but it just didn’t want to go
there.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tgres_aws1_1k.png" /></p>

<h4 id="and-what-would-happen-if-we-set-the-segment-width-to-4096">And what would happen if we set the segment width to 4096?</h4>

<p>Interestingly, the memory footprint is a tad larger while the vcache
is leaner, the number of data points flushed per second is about same,
though in fewer SQL statements, and the overall picture is about the
same and the incoming queue still skyrockets at just about 100K/sec
over 500K series.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tgres_aws1_4k.png" /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There is plenty of places in Tgres code that could still be
optimized.</p>

<p>One issue that would be worth looking into is exposing Tgres to the
firehose on an empty database. The current code runs out of memory in
under a minute when suddenly exposed to 300K new series at
150K/s. Probably the simplest solution to this would be to somehow
detect that we’ve unable to keep up and start dropping data
points. Eventually, when all the series are created and cached,
performance should even out after the initial spike and all should be
well.</p>

<p>In any event, it’s nice to be able to do something like this and know
that it is performant as well:</p>

<p>Tgres was running with the following. The <code>TGRES_BLASTER</code> starts the
blaster goroutine.</p>

<p>Once you have Tgres with the blaster running, you can control it via
HTTP, e.g. the following would set it to 50K/s data points across 100K
series. Setting rate to 0 pauses it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing on the
<a href="/blog/2016/12/16/storing-time-series-in-postgresql-part-ii/">previous</a>
write up on how time series data can be stored in Postgres
efficiently, here is another approach, this time providing for extreme
write performance.</p>

<p>The “horizontal” data structure in the last article requires an SQL
statement for every data point update. If you cache data points long
enough, you might be able to collect a bunch for a series and write
them out at once for a slight performance advantage. But there is no
way to update multiple series with a single statement, it’s always
at least one update per series. With a large number of series, this
can become a performance bottleneck. Can we do better?</p>

<p>One observation we can make about incoming time series data is that
commonly the data points are roughly from the same time period, the
current time, give or take. If we’re storing data at regularly-spaced
intervals, then it is extremely likely that many if not all of the
most current data points from various time series are going to belong
to the exact same time slot. Considering this observation, what if we
organized data points in rows of arrays, only now we would have a row
per timestamp while the position within the array would determine the
series?</p>

<p>Lets create the tables:</p>

<p>Notice how the step and size now become properties of the bundle
rather than the rra which now refers to a bundle. In the <code>ts</code> table,
<code>i</code> is the index in the round-robin archive (which in the previous
“horizontal” layout would be the array index).</p>

<p>The data we used before was a bunch of temperatures, lets add two more
series, one where temperature is 1 degree higher, and one where it’s 1
degree lower. (Not that it really matters).</p>

<a href="/blog/2016/12/16/storing-time-series-in-postgresql-part-ii/">previous article</a>)</p>

<p>And now let’s verify that it works:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>This approach makes writes blazingly fast though it does have its
drawbacks. For example there is no way to read a single series - even
though the view selects a single array element, under the hood
Postgres reads the whole row. Given that time series is more write
intensive and rarely read, this may not be a bad compromise.</p>

try to count something that goes by really fast.</p>

<p>This time let’s start out with creating a memory-based SerDe. This
means that all our data is in memory and there is no database backing
our series.</p>

<p>Now let’s create a goroutine which creates data points as fast as it
can, the difference from the previous blog post is that we are using
QueueGauge(), which is a <em>paced metric</em>, meaning that it flushes to the
time series only periodically (once per second by default) so as to
not overwhelm the I/O and or network (even though in this case it doesn’t
really matter since we’re using a memory-based SerDe anyway).</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>And finally, as before, we need to hook up a couple of http handlers:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">9</span>
<span class="line-number">10</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="go"><span class="line">    <span class="nx">db</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nx">dsl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">NewNamedDSFetcher</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ms</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Fetcher</span><span class="p">())</span>

</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span> <span class="c1">// end of main()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Now if we run the above code with something like
<code>go run simpletgres.go</code>, we’ll notice that unlike with the previous
example, the web server starts right away, and the data points are
being written while the server is running. If we aim Grafana at it,
we should be able to see the chart update in real time.</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes, mine looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/simple-tgres01.png" /></p>

<p>So my macbook can crank these out at about 2.5 million per second.</p>

<p>In my experience instrumenting my apps with simple counters like this
and having them available directly from the app without having to send
them to a separate statsd server somewhere has been extremely useful in
helping understand performance and other issues.</p>
