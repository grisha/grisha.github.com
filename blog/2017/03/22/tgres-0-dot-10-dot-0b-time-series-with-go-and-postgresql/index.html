<div class="entry-content"><p>After nearly two years of hacking, I am tagging this version of
<a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres">Tgres</a>
as beta. It is functional and stable enough for people to try out and
not feel like they are wasting their time. There is still a lot that
could and should be improved, but at this point the most
important thing is to get more people to check it out.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-tgres">What is Tgres?</h3>

<p>Tgres is a <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> program which can receive time
series data via <a href="https://graphiteapp.org/">Graphite</a>, <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/wiki">Statsd</a>
protocols or an http <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/http#PixelHandler">pixel</a>, store it
in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, and provide Graphite-like access to the data
in a way that is compatible with tools such as <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. You could think of it as a
drop-in Graphite/Statsd replacement, though I’d rather avoid direct
comparison, because the key feature of Tgres is that data is stored in
PostgreSQL.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/02/28/tgres-load-testing-follow-up/"><img src="/images/tgres_load_head_01.png" /></a></p>

<h3 id="why-postgresql">Why PostgreSQL?</h3>

<p>The “grand vision” for Tgres begins with the database. Relational
databases have the most man-decades of any storage type invested into
them, and PostgreSQL is probably the most advanced implementation
presently in existence.</p>

<p>If you search for “relational databases and time series” (or
some variation thereupon), you will come across the whole gamut of
opinions (if not convictions) varying so widely it is but
discouraging. This is because time series storage, while simple at
first glance, is actually fraught with subtleties and ambiguities that
can drive even the most patient of us up the wall.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-solving-the-storage-problem">Avoid Solving the Storage Problem.</h3>

<p>Someone once said that “anything is possible when you don’t know what
you’re talking about”, and nowhere is it more evident than in data
storage. File systems and relational databases trace their origin back
to the late 1960s and over half a century later I doubt that
any field experts would say “the storage problem is solved”. And so it seems
almost foolish to suppose that by throwing together a key-value store and a
concensus algorithm or some such it is possible to come up with
something <em>better</em>? Instead of re-inventing storage, why not focus on
how to structure the data in a way that is compatible with a
storage implementation that we know works and scales reliably?</p>

<p>As part of the Tgres project, I thought it’d be interesting to get to
the bottom of this. If not bottom, then at least deeper than most
people dare to dive. I am not a mathematician or a statistician, nor
am I a data scientist, whatever that means, but I think I understand
enough about the various subjects involved, including programming,
that I can come up with something more than just another off-the-cuff
opinion.</p>

<p>And so now I think I can conclude definitively that time
series data can be stored in a relational database very efficently, PostgreSQL in
particular for its support for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/arrays.html">arrays</a>.
The general approach I described in a series of blogs starting with
<a href="/blog/2015/09/23/storing-time-series-in-postgresql-efficiently/">this one</a>,
Tgres uses the technique described in the
<a href="/blog/2017/01/21/storing-time-seris-in-postgresql-optimize-for-write/">last one</a>.
In my <a href="/blog/2017/02/28/tgres-load-testing-follow-up/">performance tests</a>
the Tgres/Postgres combination was so efficient it was possibly
outperforming its time-series <a href="http://obfuscurity.com/2016/09/Benchmarking-Graphite-master-on-AWS">siblings</a>.</p>

<p>The good news is that as a user you don’t need to think about the
complexities of the data layout, Tgres takes care of it. Still I very
much wish people would take more time to think about how to organize
data in a tried and true solution like PostgreSQL before jumping ship
into the murky waters of the “noSQL” ocean, lured by alternative
storage sirens, big on promise but shy on delivery, only to drown
where no one could come to the rescue.</p>

<h3 id="how-else-is-tgres-different">How else is Tgres different?</h3>

<p>Tgres is a single program, a single binary which does everything
(one of my favorite things about Go). It supports all of Graphite
and Statsd protocols without having to run separate
processes, there are no dependencies of any kind other than a PostgreSQL
database. No need for Python, Node or a JVM, just the binary, the
<a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/blob/v0.10.0b/etc/tgres.conf.sample">config file</a>
and access to a database.</p>

<p>And since the data is stored in Postgres, virtually all of the
features of Postgres are available: from being able to query
the data using real SQL with all the latest features, to replication,
security, performance, back-ups and whatever else Postgres
offers.</p>

<p>Another benefit of data being in a database is that it can be
accessible to any application frameworks in Python, Ruby or whatever
other language as just another database table. For example in Rails it
might be as trivial as <code>class Tv &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end</code> et voilà,
you have the data points as a model.</p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that Tgres requires no PostgreSQL
extensions. This is because optimizing by implementing a custom
extension which circumvents the PostgreSQL natural way of handling
data means we are solving the storage problem again. PostgreSQL
storage is not broken to begin with, no customization is necessary to
handle time series.</p>

<p>In addition to being a standalone program, Tgres packages aim to be useful on their own
as part of any other Go program. For example it is very easy to equip a Go application with Graphite
capabilities by providing it access to a database and using the
provided http
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/http#GraphiteRenderHandler">handler</a>. This
also means that you can use a separate Tgres instance dedicated to querying data
(perhaps from a downstream Potgres slave).</p>

<h3 id="some-internals-overview">Some Internals Overview</h3>

<p>Internally, Tgres series identification is tag-based. The series are
identified by a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-json.html">JSONB</a>
field which is a set of key/value pairs indexed using a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/gin-intro.html">GIN index</a>.
In Go, the JSONB field becomes a
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/serde#Ident">serde.Ident</a>.
Since the “outside” interface Tgres is presently mimicking is Graphite,
which uses dot-separated series identifiers, all idents are made of just one tag
“name”, but this will change as we expand the DSL.</p>

<p>Tgres stores data in evenly-spaced series. The conversion from the
data as it comes in to its evenly-spaced form happens on-the-fly,
using a <a href="/blog/2016/08/04/data-points/">weighted mean</a> method, and
the resulting stored rate is actually correct. This is similar to how
<a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> does it, but different from
many other tools which simply discard all points except for last in the same
series slot as I explained in <a href="/blog/2015/05/04/recording-time-series/">this post</a>.</p>

<p>Tgres maintains a (configurable) number of Round-Robin Archives (RRAs)
of varying length and resolution for each series, this is an approach
similar to RRDTool and Graphite Whisper as well. The conversion to
evenly-spaced series happens in the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/rrd">rrd</a> package.</p>

<p>Tgres does not store the original (unevenly spaced) data points. The
rationale behind this is that for analytical value you always
inevitably have to convert an uneven series to a regular one. The
problem of storing the original data points is not a time-seires
problem, the main challenge there is the ability to keep up with a
massive influx of data, and this is what Hadoop, Cassandra, S3,
BigQuery, etc are excellent at.</p>

<p>While Tgres code implements most of the <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html">Graphite functions</a>,
complete compatibility with the Graphite DSL is not a goal, and some
functions will probably left uniplemented. In my opinion the Graphite
DSL has a number of shortcomings by design. For example, the series names are not
strings but are syntactically identifiers, i.e. there is no
difference between <code>scale(foo.bar, 10)</code> and <code>scale("foo.bar", 10)</code>,
which is problematic in more than one way. The dot-names are
ingrained into the DSL, and lots of functions take arguments denoting
position within the dot-names, but they seem unnecessary. For
example there is <code>averageSeriesWithWildcards</code> and
<code>sumSeriesWithWildcards</code>, while it would be cleaner to have some kind
of a <code>wildcard()</code> function which can be passed into <code>average()</code> or
<code>sum()</code>. Another example is that Graphite does not support chaining (but Tgres already
does), e.g. <code>scale(average("foo.*"), 10)</code> might be better as
<code>average("foo.*").scale(10)</code>. There are many more similar small
grievances I have with the DSL, and in the end I think that the DSL ought to be
revamped to be more like a real language (or perhaps just be a
language, e.g. Go itself), exactly how hasn’t been crystalized just
yet.</p>

<p>Tgres also aims to be a useful time-series processing Golang package
(or a set of packages). This means that in Go the code also needs to
be clean and readable, and that there ought to be a conceptual
correspondence between the DSL and how one might to something at the
lower level in Go. Again, the vision here is still blurry, and more
thinking is required.</p>

<p>For Statsd functionality, the network protocol is supported by the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/statsd">tgres/statsd</a>
package while the aggregation is done by the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/aggregator">tgres/aggregator</a>. In
addition, there is also support for “paced metrics” which let you
aggregate data <em>before</em> it is passed on to the Tgres receiver and
becomes a data point, which is useful in situations where you have
some kind of an iteration that would otherwise generate millions of
measurements per second.</p>

<p>The finest resolution for Tgres is a millisecond. Nanoseconds seems
too small to be practical, though it shouldn’t be too hard to change
it, as internally Tgres uses native Go types for time and duration -
the milliseconds are the integers in the database.</p>

<p>When the Data points are received via the network, the job of parsing the
network stuff is done by the code in the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/daemon">tgres/daemon</a>
package with some help from <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/http">tgres/http</a>
and <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/statsd">tgres/statsd</a>, as well as
potentially others (e.g. Python pickle decoding).</p>

<p>Once received and correctly parsed, they are passed on to the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/receiver">tgres/receiver</a>. The
receiver’s job is to check whether this series ident is known to us
by checking the cache or that it needs to be loaded from the
database or created. Once the appropriate series is found, the
receiver updates the in-memory cache of the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/rrd#RoundRobinArchive">RRAs</a>
for the series (which causes the data points to be evenly spaced) as well as
periodically flushes data points to the data base. The
receiver also controls the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/aggregator">aggregator</a>
of statsd metrics.</p>

<p>The database interface code is in the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/serde">tgres/serde</a>
package which supports PostgreSQL or an in-memory database (useful
in situations where persistence is not required or during testing).</p>

<p>When Tgres is queried for data, it loads it from the database
into a variety of implementations of the Series interface in the
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/series">tgres/series</a> package
as controlled by the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/dsl">tgres/dsl</a>
responsible for figuring out what is asked of it in the query.</p>

<p>In addition to all of the above, Tgres supports clustering, though this is
highly experimental at this point. The idea
is that a cluster of Tgres instances (all backed by the same database,
at least for now) would split the series amongst themselves and
forward data points to the node which is responsible for a particular
series. The nodes are placed behind a load-balancer of some kind, and
with this set up nodes can go in and out of the cluster without any
overall downtime for maximum availability. The clustering logic lives in
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tgres/tgres/cluster">tgres/cluster</a>.</p>

<p>This is an overly simplistic overview which hopefully conveys that
there are a lot of pieces to Tgres.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>In addition to a new/better DSL, there are lots of interesting ideas,
and if you have any please chime in on Github.</p>

<p>One thing that is missing in the telemetry world is encryption,
authentication and access control so that tools like Tgres could be
used to store health data securely.</p>

<p>A useful feature might be interoperability with big data tools to
store the original data points and perhaps provide means for pulling
them out of BigQuery or whatever and replay them into series - this
way we could change the resolution to anything at will.</p>

<p>Or little details like a series alias - so that a series could be
renamed. The way this would work is you rename a series while keeping
its old ident as an alias, then take your time to make sure all the
agents send data under the new name, at which point the alias can go
away.</p>

<p>Lots can also be done on the scalability front with improved
clustering, sharding, etc.</p>

<h2 id="we-could-use-your-help">We Could Use Your Help</h2>

<p>Last but not least, this is an Open Source project. It works best when
people who share the vision also contribute to the project, and this
is where you come in. If you’re interested in learning more about time
series and databases, please check it out and feel free to contribute
in any way you can!</p>
