    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step">"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"</a></em></p>

<p>Most of my journeys never begin, or cannot continue because of that one
single step, be it first or next. Because it is hard, at times
excruciatingly so.</p>

<p>I recon it's because I do not think in steps. I think of a
destination. And where I travel, there are no signs. I have images of
the glorious end-result. I have a dream. I can picture it with
clarity, in detail. I know where I need to be. But what is the next
step to get there?</p>

<p>Here I speak of software, but this applies to many other aspects of my
life just as well.</p>

<p>The problem of deciding what to do next happens to me so often that I
even have a name for it. I call it "The Next Smallest Step"
problem. Whenever I find myself idling, flipping over to online
time-wasters such as HN or Facebook, I pause and ask myself "What is
the Next Smallest Step?  Think, think!  What's the next smallest thing
I can do, right now?"</p>

<p>It doesn't matter how much further this small step moves me. A
nanometer is better than standing still. It has to be something that
is simple enough that I can just do. Right now.</p>

<p>I always plan to do big things that will take many hours, days, weeks
or months. But of all that, can I pick that one small simple and quick
thing that I can do now?</p>

<p>Sometimes I pencil this question on a piece of paper, and sometimes I
just type it on the command line or in the source code. My short
version is:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ WHAT NEXT?
bash: WHAT: command not found
</code></p>

<p>(that's right, in CAPS)</p>

<p>This simple question has taken me on some of the most fascinating and
challenging journeys ever. In restrospect, I think I would not be able
to travel any of them without repeatedly asking it of myself, over and
over again.</p>

<p>It has resulted in most productive and gratifying days of work. Some
of my greatest projects begun with this question. In many instances it
established with clarity what I had to do for months ahead (years,
even?). All beginning with this trivial act of asking.</p>

<p>Conversely <em>not</em> asking it often enough, if at all, led to time having
gone by without any results to show for and many a great opportunity
lost.</p>

<p>I must also note that some of my next smallest steps took days of
thinking to figure out. Nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>And so I thought I'd share this with you, just in case you might find
it helpful. Whenever you find yourself at an impass and progress seems
to have stopped, just ask yourself:</p>

<p>"What is the Next Smallest Step?"</p>
