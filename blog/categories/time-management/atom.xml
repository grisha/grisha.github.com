    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step">"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"</a></em></p>

<p>Most of my journeys never begin, or cannot continue because of that one
single step, be it first or next. Because it is hard, at times
excruciatingly so.</p>

<p>Here I speak of software, but this applies to many other aspects of my
life just as well.</p>

<p>I recon it's because I do not think in steps. I think of a
destination.  I imagine the end-result. I can picture it with clarity
and in great detail. I know where I need to be. But what is the next
step to get there? And it doesn't help that where I travel, there are
no signs.</p>

<p>The problem of deciding what to do next is so common for me that I
even have a name for it. I call it "The Next Smallest Step"
problem. Whenever I find myself idling, clicking over to online
time-wasters, I pause and ask myself "What is the Next Smallest Step?
What's the next smallest thing I can do, right now?"</p>

<p>It doesn't matter how much further this small step moves me. A
nanometer is better than standing still. It has to be something that
is simple enough that I can just do. Right now.</p>

<p>I always plan to do big things that take days, weeks or months. But of
all that, can I pick that one small simple and quick thing that I can
do now?</p>

<p>Sometimes focusing on the next smallest step is so difficult that I
pencil this question on a piece of paper, and sometimes I just type it
on the command line or in the source code. My short version is:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ WHAT NEXT?
bash: WHAT: command not found
</code></p>

<p>(that's right, in CAPS)</p>

<p>This simple question has taken me on some of the most fascinating and
challenging journeys ever. In restrospect, I think I would not be able
to travel any of them without repeatedly asking it of myself, over and
over again.</p>

<p>It has resulted in most productive and gratifying days of work. Some
of my greatest projects began with this question. In many instances it
established what I had to do for months ahead (years, even?). All
beginning with this one small question.</p>

<p>Conversely <em>not</em> asking it often enough, if at all, led to time having
gone by without any results to show for and many a great opportunity
lost.</p>

<p>I must also note that some of my next smallest steps took days of
thinking to figure out. Nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>And so I thought I'd share this with you, just in case you might find
it helpful. Whenever you find yourself at an impass and progress
has stopped, ask yourself:</p>

<p>"What is the Next Smallest Step?"</p>
