loaded into memory so that a (very fast) join could be performed

<p>There are two ways to enable it. First is by using a hint, which looks
like <code>/*+ MAPJOIN(aliasname), MAPJOIN(anothertable) */</code>. This C-style comment
should be placed immediately following the <code>SELECT</code>. It directs Hive
to load <code>aliasname</code> (which is a table or alias of the query) into
memory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT</span> <span style="color:#75715e">/*+ MAPJOIN(c) */</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span> orders o <span style="color:#66d9ef">JOIN</span> cities <span style="color:#66d9ef">c</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">ON</span> (o.city_id <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">c</span>.id);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Another (better, in my opinion) way to turn on mapjoins is to let Hive
do it automatically. Simply set <code>hive.auto.convert.join</code> to true in
your config, and Hive will automatically use mapjoins for any tables
smaller than <code>hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize</code> (default is 25MB).</p>
<p>Mapjoins have a limitation in that the same table or alias cannot be
used to join on different columns in the same query. (This makes sense
because presumably Hive uses a HashMap keyed on the column(s) used in
the join, and such a HashMap would be of no use for a join on
different keys).</p>
<p>The workaround is very simple - do not use the same aliases in your
query.</p>
<p>I also found that when the Hive documentation states that such queries
are &ldquo;<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/Hive/languagemanual-joins.html#LanguageManualJoins-Mapjoinrestrictions">not supported</a>&rdquo;
they mean that the query will fail in unexpected
ways, sometimes with a Java traceback.
