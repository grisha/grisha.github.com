<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform">Terraform</a> to build
all the AWS infrastructure. Initially I was skeptical on how well it
could accomplish such a tedious task, but I have say my confidence in
Terraform grew the more I used it.</p>
<p>The main top level tool for everything is the good old
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29">make</a>, a tool that
stood the test of time.</p>
<p>Here is the code of the example, read the README, I hope you find it
useful:</p>
