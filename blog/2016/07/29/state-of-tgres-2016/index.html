    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-100-l"><p><a href="http://github.com/tgres/tgres">Tgres</a> is a metrics collection and storage server, aka a time series
database. I&rsquo;m not very comfortable with referring to it as a
<em>database</em>, because at least in case of Tgres, the database is
actually PostgreSQL. But also &ldquo;database&rdquo; to me is in the same category
as &ldquo;operating system&rdquo; or &ldquo;compiler&rdquo;, a thing so advanced that only few
can claim to be it without appearing pretentious. But for the sake of
tautology avoidance, I might occasionally refer to Tgres as a TS
database.</p>
<p>Ulike <a href="https://graphiteapp.org/">Graphite</a> or
<a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a>, Tgres produces no charts,
it assumes you&rsquo;re using something like
<a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a>. Currently Tgres supports most of the
Graphite functionality (including vast majority of the functions) as
well as Statsd functionality. Tgres supports clustering, albeit
whereby all nodes must share the PostgreSQL instance. Tgres can be
used as a standalone server or as a Go package compiled into your app.</p>
<h3 id="current-status">Current status</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s been over a year since I began hacking on it in this incarnation,
though the idea and a couple of scrapped implementations thereof go
back more than two years. Tgres is still not quite production quality,
though it&rsquo;s probably stable enough for someone who knows their way
around Go to give it a whirl. At this point I have proven the concept,
and believe the architecture is sound, but the magnitude of the
project turned out to be much grater than I originally pictured, and
so it still needs lots and lots of proofreading, t&rsquo;s crossed and i&rsquo;s
dotted.</p>
<h2 id="raisons-detre">Raisons d&rsquo;etre</h2>
<h3 id="with-go-new-things-are-possible">With Go, new things are possible</h3>
<p>The idea of a TS database came about when I first decided to dive into
<a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>. Go can do great stuff, but I didn&rsquo;t see
how it applied to anything I was working on at
the time. I needed a project that was a better match for the domain of
applications that Go made possible, something where performance and scale
matter, something with concurrent moving pieces, something
challenging. A &ldquo;time series database&rdquo; seemed like it had potential. It
has all kinds of curious requirements that could be great fun to
implement in Go.</p>
<h3 id="present-state-of-time-series-databases-is-dismal">Present state of &ldquo;time series databases&rdquo; is dismal</h3>
<p>I was (and still am) frustrated with the state of TS in our
industry. Since the appearance of
<a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/doc/mrtg.en.html">MRTG</a> back in 1995 when
the network admins of the then burgeoning Internet realized that TS is
essential to device monitoring, not much has happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDTool</a> was definitely a major step
forward from MRTG which was merely a Perl script. RRDTool to this day
is the best implementation of a round-robin database for time series
data (in C to boot). Similarly to MRTG, RRDTool was designed as a command-line tool,
the server component was left as an exercise for the user. And even
though linking RRDTool into your app was not too difficult (I
<a href="https://github.com/grisha/openvps-common/blob/master/py-rrd/_RRD.c">did it</a>
in 2004), somehow an &ldquo;RRD server&rdquo; never appeared.</p>
<p>Then there was <a href="https://graphiteapp.org/">Graphite</a>. (I think Graphite
is a reflection of the Python-can-do-anything era.) Graphite borrowed
a lot of ideas from RRDTool, though its re-implementation of
round-robin on-disk files in pure Python while <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/whisper">claiming superiority</a> is not that much
better, if at all, IMHO when compared to RRDTool in both accuracy and
performance. In general though, I think storing data directly in files
is the wrong approach to begin with.</p>
<p>Graphite&rsquo;s appeal is that it&rsquo;s an easy-to-start server that does
everything, and it became especially popular alongside
<a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/wiki">Statsd</a> a tool with umpteen
different implementation designed to sit in front of
Graphite. Eventually people stopped using Graphite to make charts
favoring instead the most excellent Grafana,
while Graphite (or its nephew <a href="https://github.com/brutasse/graphite-api">Graphite-API</a>)
became a UI-less server-only component to store and retrieve data.</p>
<p>Graphite and RRDTool didn&rsquo;t scale very well, so for &ldquo;Big Time Series&rdquo;
(as in very large networks, or specialized fields like finance,
weather, etc.) people used solutions backed by
<a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>, <a href="https://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</a>,
or <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> such as
<a href="http://opentsdb.net/">OpenTSDB</a>.</p>
<p>There are also new kids on the block such as
<a href="https://influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> or
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>, which are a little too flashy
and commercial by my taste, each trying to solve problems that I don&rsquo;t
think I have.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that some 20 years after MRTG, time series remains
mostly a system monitoring aid and has never crossed over to the
mainstream application development.</p>
<h3 id="data-isolation">Data isolation</h3>
<p>Virtually all of the aforementioned tools contribute to a problem I
dub <em>data isolation</em>. Data isolation is when a part of our data is
stored using a separate tool in a different format and is therefore
not as easily accessible.  For example if our metrics are in Graphite,
we probably don&rsquo;t even know how to get them out of it, nor does it
occur to us that it might be useful.  All we&rsquo;ve been able to do is get
a Grafana chart and are quite satisfied with it. We do not question
why it isn&rsquo;t a first-class citizen right in the database as a table,
where we could use it in SQL joins, for example. Or export it to our
big data rig and query it with Hive or Spark, etc.</p>
<p>Why is getting a quick chart of customer sign-ups per second next to
all my customer data such a big deal these days? Why can&rsquo;t it be as
simple as a model in my Rails or Django app?</p>
<h3 id="postgresql---avoid-the-storage-mire">PostgreSQL - Avoid the storage mire</h3>
<p>I believe that there is nothing about time series that makes it unfit
for a relational database. Many projects out there are spinning
their wheels solving the wrong problem, that of data storage. Storage
is one of the hardest problems in computers, time series databases
should focus on time series and delegate the storage to tried-and-true
tools which are good at it.</p>
<p>Time series data does carry certain special requirements, and I&rsquo;ve
researched extensively all different ways TS can be stored in a
relational database. It does require taking advantage of some newer
features that in the open source database world seem most available in
PostgreSQL. I am guessing that with time these capabilities will
become more available in other databases, and some of them already
are, but for the time being I&rsquo;ve decided that Tgres is
PostgreSQL-only.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-detail">A bit of detail</h2>
<h3 id="emulating-graphite-as-a-starting-point">Emulating Graphite as a starting point</h3>
<p>I would like Tgres to be useful. The simplest way I could think of
achieving usefulness is by emulating an existing tool so that it can
become a drop-in replacement. This makes adoption easy and it also
proves that the underlying architecture is capable. It also lets us
compare performance.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I am a fan of how Graphite does things, but I
think that if Tgres is architected in such a way that there is a lower
level which does the heavy lifting and then a layer on top of it that
makes it behave like Graphite, that&rsquo;s a great start, and it leaves
options open for potential improvement and a different/better
interface.</p>
<h3 id="general-terminology">General terminology</h3>
<p>I always liked how RRDTool documentation broke down the problem of
time series into concise and clear terms. Tgres tries to leverage the
RRDTool terminology. Tgres also adopts the same techniques to the
extent that is possible given a considerably different
architecuture. Unlike RRDTool, Tgres uses a millisecond as the
smallest unit of time measure.</p>
<h4 id="data-point-dp">Data Point (DP)</h4>
<p>A <em>data point</em> is a <em>value</em> (a floating point number) a <em>time stamp</em>
and a string <em>name</em> identifying the series. (For a while I
contemplated allowing a data point to have multiple values, but it
made things too complicated, so I reverted to a single value per data
point).</p>
<h4 id="round-robin-archive-rra">Round-Robin Archive (RRA)</h4>
<p>Tgres stores data points in <em>round-robin archives</em>.  While
&ldquo;round-robin&rdquo; is an implementation detail, it is part of the name
because the only way it can be round-robin is the number of data
points in the archive is constant. The time-span of the RRA is determined
by the <em>step</em> (resolution) and the <em>size</em> of the archive (in steps). Thus RRA&rsquo;s are
defined by step and size, e.g. 10s for 24 hours (a data point every
10s for 24 hours, or 8,640 points).</p>
<p>A series is usually is stored in multiple RRA&rsquo;s. The RRA&rsquo;s typically
have varying resolutions, e.g. we want a 10s step for the past 24h,
but also a 1h step for a week and a 6h step for 3 years. In this
example we have 3 RRA&rsquo;s. Tgres takes care of maintaining the RRA&rsquo;s and
selecting the right resultion for a given query so that there is no
need to deal with individual RRA&rsquo;s directly.</p>
<h4 id="data-source-ds">Data Source (DS)</h4>
<p>A group of RRA&rsquo;s under the same identifier (aka series name) is
referred to as a data source (DS). I suppose &ldquo;DS&rdquo; can be used
interchangeably with &ldquo;series&rdquo;. Depending on how Tgres is configured,
DS&rsquo;s are either predefined or are created on the fly based on DS name
matching rules.</p>
<p>Note that Tgres does not store the original data points, but only the
weighted averages of the received data points in each RRA. This is how
RRDTool does it. Graphite doesn&rsquo;t bother averaging the points but
simply discards previous data points within the same step. At first it
may seem not ideal that the original data is discarded, but experience
shows that just about any time series operation results in a
conversion to a fixed interval form as the first step, so it might as
well just be done upfront.</p>
<h4 id="heartbeat-hb">Heartbeat (HB)</h4>
<p>Every DS has a <em>heartbeat</em>, a time duration which defines the longest
possible period of inactivity before the DS becomes considered
dysfunctional. If the heartbeat is exceeded, the data since the last
update will be recorded as NaNs.</p>
<h4 id="xfiles-factor-xff">Xfiles factor (XFF)</h4>
<p>When data is consolidated from smaller to larger step RRAs, the XFF
determines how much of the data is allowed to be NaN before the
consolidated value becomes NaN. For example if we are consolidating
per-minute values into a per-hour value, if one of the minutes happens
to be NaN, strictly speaking the whole hour ought ot be NaN, but that
wouldn&rsquo;t be very useful. Default XFF is .5, i.e. more than half of the
per-minute values should be NaN before the per-hour value is
considered NaN.</p>
<h3 id="postgres-storage-format">Postgres storage format</h3>
<p>A time series is a series of floats. Note that when it&rsquo;s stored in
RRA&rsquo;s, there is no need for timestamps - each position in an RRA has
its timestamp defined by the current state of the RRA. If we know the
timestamp of the tip, we know the timestamp of every element going
back to the beginning of the RRA.</p>
<p>To store data points Tgres takes advantage of PostgreSQL arrays. A
single row stores many data points. Tgres further splits series into
multiple rows to optimize the IO.</p>
<p>To make the data easy to use, Tgres also creates a view which makes
the data points structured as a regular table with a row per data
point.</p>
<p>There are only 3 tables and 1 view required for Tgres operation. You
can use the same database you use for any other web app you have. This
means you can access the time series by simply just adding a model
pointing at the Tgres time series view to your Rails/Django/whatever
to get access to the data.</p>
<h2 id="tgres-components">Tgres components</h2>
<p>Tgres is organized as a set of Go packages.</p>
<h3 id="tgresdaemon">tgres/daemon</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/master/daemon">daemon</a> is the
main process that runs everything. It includes the config parser, and
the listeners that receive and parse incoming data points using both
UDP and TCP Graphite formats, as well as Python Pickle format (though
I&rsquo;m not sure who out there really uses it). It&rsquo;s not too hard to add
more formats, for example I think it&rsquo;d be neat if Tgres could receive
data points via an HTTP pixel that could be embedded in web pages.</p>
<p>The daemon also takes care of graceful restarts, logging and other
typical long-running service stuff.</p>
<h3 id="trgesreceiver">trges/receiver</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/master/receiver">receiver</a>
(formerly known as transceiver) is the data point router and cache. It
maintains a set of workers responsible for writing the data points to
their respective RRA&rsquo;s, as well as caching and periodic flushing of
the cache. Flushing is done once a certian number of points has
accumulated or a period of time has passed, but not more often than
the minimal flush frequency (all configurable).</p>
<h3 id="tgresrrd">tgres/rrd</h3>
<p>The responsibility of <a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/master/rrd">rrd</a> is to add data
points to RRA&rsquo;s. This is not as simple as it sounds, a good
description of the concepts behind it is available <a href="http://rrdtool.vandenbogaerdt.nl/process.php#Rate">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tgreshttp">tgres/http</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/master/http">http</a> is the place
for all things related to HTTP, which currently is just the Graphite
API. The API requests are passed down to the DSL level for processing.</p>
<h3 id="tgresdsl">tgres/dsl</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/master/dsl">dsl</a> is an
implementation of the Graphite
<a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html">functions</a>. There
are a few differences because I used the Go parser which is nearly
syntactically identical. (For example a series name cannot begin with
a digit because that is not a proper Go identifier).</p>
<p>Graphite has a lot number of functions available in its DSL, and I
spent a lot of time during our beach vacation last summer trying to
implement them all, but I think a few are still left undone. Some were
harder than others, and some led me on side adventures such as
figuring out the Holt-Winters triple exponential smoothing and how to
do it correctly. (ZZZ - link)</p>
<h3 id="tgresserde">tgres/serde</h3>
<p>The interface to the database is reduced to a fairly compact
<a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/master/serde">SerDe</a>
(Serialize-Deserializer) interface. While the SerDe itself is utterly
simplistic (e.g. &ldquo;get me this series&rdquo;), the SQL behind it anything
but, still, it should be possible to throw together an alternative
SerDe for a different relational database (or not a database at all?).</p>
<h3 id="tgresstatsd">tgres/statsd</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/master/statsd">Statsd</a> is currently
in a separate Go package, but I might integrate with the RRD because
it is not very clear that it needs to be a separate thing. Somehow it
so happened that Graphite and Statd are two separate projects, but the
reasons for this are probably more cultural than by design.</p>
<h3 id="tgrescluster">tgres/cluster</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tgres/tgres/tree/master/cluster">Cluster</a> supports
very basic clustering. At this point it&rsquo;s &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; given that
it&rsquo;s OK to occasionally lose data points during cluster transitions
and all that we want to make sure of is that nodes can come and go
without disruptions.</p>
<p>The principle behind cluster is that each node is responsible for one
or more series and other nodes will forward data points to the
responsible node. There is nearly zero configuration, and any node can
act as the point of contact, i.e. there is no leader.</p>
<p>The way clustering is done is in flux at the moment, we might change
it to something more robust in the near future, but for the time being
it addresses the horizontal scaling problem.</p>
<h2 id="theres-still-lots-to-do">There&rsquo;s still lots to do&hellip;</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of work to be done on Tgres. For one thing, I
don&rsquo;t have any tests. This is mainly because I don&rsquo;t believe in
testing that which hasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;gelled&rdquo;, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the
above organization of packages and how they interface changes as I
understand the problem better. We also need documentation. And some
real-life use/testing/feedback would be great as well.</p>
