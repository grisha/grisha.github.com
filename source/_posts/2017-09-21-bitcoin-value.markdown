To me, the fundamental question about Bitcoin is not whether it is
sound from the mathematical viewpoint, as I am convinced that it
is. The real question is: what is it?

### Money is Debt Ink ###

To define Bitcoin we need to look back at the history of _money_.
Originally, money was in the form of things that were scarce and
impossible to falsify, something like specific shape sea shells. These
shells, or shall we refer to them as _tokens_, represented _debt_.

It was generally agreed upon that things of value could be traded
for these tokens. Once monetary tokens were invented, we no longer
needed to decide what to barter right there and then, we could
postpone the decision. One could _sell_ milk for tokens, then use
those tokens to _buy_ a spear later, this way the milk didn't spoil
while waiting for the spear to be made.

Thus a sale is really a _loan_ in disguise. The tokens received for
the sold milk were a _record of debt_ that is owed to the seller. Tokens
are the ink in which this record was written.

It's noteworthy that there is no money if there is no debt, or that
money implies debt. It's a simple principle that few people consider.

### Why Should Ink have Value? ###

Later people started using rare metals such as gold or silver as
money.  Metals were better than sea shells because they were
divisible. We could now make arbitrary size tokes we called (coined?)
_coins_.

Although we intuitively think that gold has a lot of value, in reality
it has very little. Gold does not feed us or keep us warm. It does
have some unique properties, but back when we started using gold as
money we couldn't possibly appreciate them, other than perhaps that is
was pretty and extremely durable. It was also rare. But does rarity
imply value? The sea shells were completely worthless before they were
used as money, yet they too were rare.

### World-Wide Debt Ledger ###

One way of thinking about money is that it is the medium in which we
maintained a world-wide ledger of debt. The entries in this ledger
were written not in ink, but in physical scarce tokens. And only the
people in possession of the tokens actually knew how much they had,
which is kind of interesting too.

### Banks and Records of Records (of Records) ###

But it turned out that keeping valuable tokens was difficult, they
could be lost or stolen, and worse, people were willing to kill for
them. And so people decided to keep them all safe in one place.  This
was the original _bank_.

The bank issued paper notes that corresponded to the gold in the
vault, and these paper notes could be traded for anything. This was
because people knew that even though the paper is worthless, it
represents gold that is in the bank. At any time one could go to the
bank, give the bank the paper note and receive gold (at which point
the bank would destroy the paper note because the debt is settled).

A paper note is a _record of the record_ of debt. It's a mind-twister,
but we've become really good at rewriting the original debt ledger in
other mediums, and now bank vauls have paper cash, while the bank's
computer keeps a _record of the record of the record_ of debt.

### Real Estate Ink ###

At some point bankers realized that they can manipulate the monetary
supply because only the bankers actually knew how much gold they
had. And this is actually not entirely irrelevant when it comes to
Bitcoin.

Eventually it was decided that not just gold, but anyhting could be
similarly held by the bank so that more paper noted could be
issued. Most notably real estate, the arrangement of issuing paper
notes for a house is known as a mortgage. And since a house cannot be
placed into the vault, it too had to be recorded, creating yet another
layer of abstraction. It all ended with collateralized debt
obligations, credit default swaps and ultimately the 2008 subprime
mortgage crisis.

### Monetary System is Just a Ledger ###

The bottom line remains: we kept a legder. The recording medium was
precious metals, then evolved to paper and metals, and finally when we
went off the gold standard it became just paper reflecting value of
arbitrary things held under lien as collateral.

### Enter Blockchain ###

The Bitcoin _blockchian_ is also medium for this legder, only instead
of relying on scarcity of precious metals, the scarcity is in the
mathematical complexity of a problem.

And this is where our minds begin to play tricks on us, because this
is a concept previously unknown to humans. A Bitcoin, which takes an
enormous amount of computational power to generate, is actually,
really scarce. Yes, it is not physical, it is just "knowlegde" or
"information", but by all laws of nature it is scarce, in fact more
scarce than gold, the total amount of which in the universe isn't
fully known.

### But Bitcoin is just an Agreement? ###

Interestingly, Bitcoin is merely an agreement and one might argue we
can collectively decide to increase the 21 million limit. Can we
actually do that, or will it not be Bitcoin at that point, or what
happens?

But we already have a lot of things that we agree on and we don't
really question how it happened. The aforementioned shells were
collectively agreed upon. We agree on what the current date is, how
did that happen? In fact, much of what the world is, just _is_,
including the fiat money (where "fiat" literally means "let it be
done"). And so now Bitcoin just is.

### Alternative Realities ###

The name Bitcoin refers to a specific blockchain. The name could have
been different, the parameters of the algorithm could have been
different, just like the dollar bills could have been blue. There are
other cryptographic currencies, and they are different, they too now
exist. (Caveat: some of them are mathemtically bogus).

One could argue that gold exists in nature, while Bitcoin was created
by man, and thus gold is somehow more real. But Bitcoin rests on the
mathematical principles that too are just part of this universe, they
were not created by man, they were discovered and applied, and again
in this sense Bitcoin isn't much different than gold.

### The Mystery of Value ###

The mystery to me is how we collectively set a value of things like
gold or Bitcoins. Now that we've demonstrated that as money, they are
equivalent. Why is an ounce of gold worth $1300? Who decided that? The
market?

To be continued...
