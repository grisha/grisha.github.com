Recently I found myself needing to connect to HiveServer2 with
kerberos authentication enabled from a Ruby app. As it turned out
[rbhive gem](https://github.com/forward3d/rbhive) we were using did not have
support for kerberos authentication. So I had to
[roll my own](https://github.com/forward3d/rbhive/pull/23).

This post is to document the experience of figuring out the details of
a SASL/GSSAPI connection before it is lost forever in my neurons and synapses.

First, the terminology. The authentication system that Hadoop uses is
_kerberos_.
