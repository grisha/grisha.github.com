On a completely different subject, I find it remarkable how easily,
we, as a society, can throw around assertions of existence or
inexistence. As purveyors of goods entirely of conceptual nature us
programmers ought to be particularly attuned to the subtleties
involved.

Think of a recently demolished building. Does it still exist? As a
building, not really, yet all of its atoms are still around (possibly
as energy). Both before and after demolition all that the building was
made of existed physically, but what we refer to as a "building" is a
particular physical configuration, which was no longer due to the
demolition.

Does [Tom Sawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sawyer) exist?
Wikipedia obviously thinks so, and most readers would recognize the
name as that of a widely known fictional character. As a *concept*,
Tom Sawer undeniably exists. Yet no particle has ever comprised
him. In other words *physically* he does not exist. And if all the
beings capable of conceptualizing Tom ceased to exist, would he follow
their fate, or would he still be?

Okay, Tom Sawyer being imaginary is one thing, but how about
[mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics)?  Does math
exist?  Could we state that math does not exist? That would sound
crazy, though we could state that *physically* math does not
exist. Unlike Tom Sawyer, however, we can't claim mathematics to have
been imagined by us. The ratio of a circle's circumference to its
diameter had existed as a [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi)
before any intelligent life and will continue to exist long after
we're gone. Yet the statement that Pi *physically* does not exist
somehow sounds slightly odd to my ear, after all Pi is fundamental to
the laws of nature to which all things physical conform. One key
subtelty here is whether existence implies recognition: before we
understood algebra or geometry they didn't exist, but now, after
millenia of scientific exploration and discovery they do? Or have they
always existed, irrespective of anyone's understanding?

And finally, what about the being whose existence is most contested:
[God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God). Does God exist? As a concept
God quite certainly exists. Regardless of whether you belive that God
exists, you do recognize the concept. Physically though,
it is not likely that God exists, after all, if you had god-like
abilities and created your own universe including the mere concept of
existence, it probably wouldn't apply to you and you wouldn't actually
be in it? And so if physically God does not exist, is God in the same
category as Pi? Has God never existed, always existed, only existed
when recognized, existed irrespective of our understanding or neither
of the above?

Think carefully next time you use the word "is"...
