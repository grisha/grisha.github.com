### Definition of Failure ###

ZZZ

### Cryptography problem ###

SHA256 turns out to be vulnerable. Not likely.

### Protocol Problem

Something along the lines of the DAO hack, where "as designed" use is
somehow exploited. Not likely, provided BTC continues to make slow
calculated moves.

### Miner Discord ###

We shall see what 2x brings

### Government Crackdown ###

Plausible

### Competition ###

Hash Rate

"Government coin" - not possible.

### Fading into Irrelevancy ###

(Aside from competition). Not likely.
