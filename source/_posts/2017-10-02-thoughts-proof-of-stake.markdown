### Proof of Stake ###

My present take on this is that it is not going to work, or at least
not the same way as proof-of-work. There is quite a bit written on the
subject and I don't think I understand the problem well enough to
assert anything, these are just some points that are important.

PoS is not that much different from the present fiat system we
have. There are veriation-specific checks such as randomization of the
stakeholders, etc, but fundamentally, it is the currency itself which
gives you the authority to decide and in our fiat banking system the
rich decide what happens.


PoS is solving a non-problem, it is treating a feature as a bug. The
large energy consumption required for Bitcoin block solving known as
proof-of-work arguably _is_ the invention of 21st century. It is thus
far the only way known to tie the physical world energy to
information. Proof-of-work is what makes Bitcoin physically scarce
just like gold.

If the energy consumption worries you, take a look at the sun, that
should realy freak you out.


PoS works only if the currency has value. If the value drops for
whatever reason, then the stake is worthless and anyhting can
happen. Again this is similar to fiat - everything is fine until
hyperinflation, at which point fiat is only good for keeping the
fireplace going. PoW has costs irrespective of the perceived value.
