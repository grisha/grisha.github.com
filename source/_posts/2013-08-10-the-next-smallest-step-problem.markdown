*["A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step)*

Most of my journeys never begin, or cannot continue because of that one
single step, be it first or next. Because it is hard, at times
excruciatingly so.

I recon it's because I do not think in steps. I think of a
destination. And where I travel, there are no signs. I have images of
the glorious end-result. I have a dream. I can picture it with
clarity, in detail. I know where I need to be. But what is the next
step to get there?

Here I speak of software, but this applies to many other aspects of my
life just as well.

The problem of deciding what to do next happens to me so often that I
even have a name for it. I call it "The Next Smallest Step"
problem. Whenever I find myself idling, flipping over to online
time-wasters such as HN or Facebook, I pause and ask myself "What is
the Next Smallest Step?  Think, think!  What's the next smallest thing
I can do, right now?"

It doesn't matter how much further this small step moves me. A
nanometer is better than standing still. It has to be something that
is simple enough that I can just do. Right now.

I always plan to do big things that will take many hours, days, weeks
or months. But of all that, can I pick that one small simple and quick
thing that I can do now?

Sometimes I pencil this question on a piece of paper, and sometimes I
just type it on the command line or in the source code. My short
version is:

```bash
$ WHAT NEXT?
bash: WHAT: command not found
```

(that's right, in CAPS)

This simple question has taken me on some of the most fascinating and
challenging journeys ever. In restrospect, I think I would not be able
to travel any of them without repeatedly asking it of myself, over and
over again.

It has resulted in most productive and gratifying days of work. Some
of my greatest projects begun with this question. In many instances it
established with clarity what I had to do for months ahead (years,
even?). All beginning with this trivial act of asking.

Conversely *not* asking it often enough, if at all, led to time having
gone by without any results to show for and many a great opportunity
lost.

I must also note that some of my next smallest steps took days of
thinking to figure out. Nothing wrong with that.

And so I thought I'd share this with you, just in case you might find
it helpful. Whenever you find yourself at an impass and progress seems
to have stopped, just ask yourself:

"What is the Next Smallest Step?"
