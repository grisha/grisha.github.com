  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I live in the Grater Washington DC area and currently work at LivingSocial.</p>
  <p>I've been programming professionally since my teenage years (which were entirely too long ago).</p>
  <p>Many years ago I wrote <a href="http://modpython.org">mod_python</a>, which was a hugely succesful Open Source Project back in the day.</p>
  <p>I've spent most of my career working at large ISP's, though these days I'm more interested in Big Data.</p>
  <p>I was born and grew up in Moscow, Russia.</p>
  <p>Grisha is a common Russian short name for Gregory. It is pronounced more like Greesha.</p>
