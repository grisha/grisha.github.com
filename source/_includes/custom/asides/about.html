  <p>I am currently a (Data) Hacker at <a href="http://voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a>.</p>
  <p>Grisha is a common Russian short name for Gregory. It is pronounced more like Greesha.</p>
  <p>Years ago I wrote <a href="http://modpython.org">mod_python</a>, which became a hugely succesful OSS Project and is still in use by millions of sites.</p>
  <p>I am a former VP and member emeritus of the <a href="http://apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>
  <p>I started programming professionally back when I was a teenager.
  I've spent most of my early career working at large ISP's solving industrial-scale hosting challenges. Since around 2009 I've become more intersted in and now work exclusively on data infrastuctre, both big and small, but mostly big.</p>
  <p>I was born and grew up in Moscow, Russia, though I've lived in the Washington, DC (USA) area for more than half of my life now. Our kids were born and go to school here, it's gradually become home for us.</p>
